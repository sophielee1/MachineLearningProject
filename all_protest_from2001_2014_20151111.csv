The villager sought revenge against the local government after being investigated for taking sand from village plots. On two occasions, the instigators rallied as many as 200 primary school pupils and protesters to demonstrate outside the town government office. Windows and cars were smashed, and the instigators set fire to the offices and looted equipment. Text of report by reporter Fang Yiqing and correspondent Li Xisong, carried by Chinese newspaper from Guangzhou Nanfang Ribao on 20 FebruaryThis reporter learned last evening from a pertinent department of Shantou City that Chaoyang City's Xiancheng Town on 11 February witnessed a malignant, well-organized, and premeditated incident of beating, smashing, looting, and burning the town government's office buildings under the pretext of student tuition problems. Thanks to the resolute approach of Shantou and Chaoyang city governments, the incident was quelled in a timely manner. During the whole process of handling, not a single civilian was injured. Thus far, the Xiancheng Town government has already resumed its office work, and elementary and middle schools in the town are holding classes as usual. Meanwhile, public security organs have already arrested 21 criminal suspects.At about 1300 on 11 February, a handful of illegal elements in Xiancheng Town organized 49 pupils of Xincheng Elementary School to march to the town government for a demonstration against the tuition problem. They poured into the government buildings and then instigated some masses, who were unaware of the truth, to dash into the government compound to beat and smash windows and cars there. Informed of this, party and government cadres of Chaoyang City and related departments immediately rushed to the scene of the riot for mediation and persuasion. At about 1600 that afternoon, the 49 pupils were brought back by their parents or teachers. However, a few illegal elements still stayed there to make trouble without fearing anything. At about 1800 that evening, these persons went so far as to set fires to government offices. Through the all-out efforts of cadres and policemen, the riot was basically brought under control around 2340 that night.At about 1000 the next day, these illegal elements once again incited some 200 masses in Xiancheng Town to make troubles at the town government buildings. Amid the chaos, these illegal elements frenziedly burst in the offices to loot office appliances and to smash and burn all the windows and equipment of the four office buildings in the government compound. After hearing this, the Shantou City authorities dispatched the police to the scene to help handle the case. Through the patient mass work and persuasion by leaders and public security cadres, the incident calmed down finally.Thanks to the resolute approach, the damages caused by this incident have been minimized. It was reported that during the whole process of the incident, some windows and office facilities of the government buildings were smashed and burned, three cars were damaged, and three policemen were injured only. No civilian was injured.On the afternoon of 12 February, Shantou and Chaoyang city governments convened an on-the-spot office meeting to deal with the aftermath of the incident and to specifically deploy and implement the following rectification and correction measures. First, a leading group composed of functional departments will be established to immediately investigate the tuition problems of local elementary and middle schools. And, all the unreasonable tuition fees will be returned to students at once. Second, various types of meetings will be convened to conduct legal propaganda and education among the masses. Investigation will be carried out, and evidence will be obtained promptly. And, organizers of the incident and troublemakers will be thoroughly examined and severely punished according to law. Third, the Xiancheng Town party committee and government will be instructed to clear the scene of the riot and to restore the office work as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, the control over social communities will be strengthened, and the order in production and daily life will be restored as soon as possible in order to minimize the impact from the incident. Fourth, an emergency meeting with the participation of party committee secretaries of various towns (neighbourhoods) will be held to report the course of the incident. Various towns (neighbourhoods) will be arranged to strengthen the ideological and political education among students. Furthermore, the collection of unwarranted fees and surcharges will be strictly banned in order to prevent such incidents from emerging in other localities and to ensure the stability of society.According to the initial investigation, the cause of this incident is: A villager in Xiancheng Town's Xinxing Village had a grievance against the town land station because he was investigated for privately taking sand from the village's cultivated land. Then, on the afternoon of 11 February, he secretly organized 49 pupils of Xinxing Elementary School to march to the town government to reflect the tuition problem and seized this opportunity to incite the riot. Now, public security organs are making all-out efforts to trace and arrest the criminal suspects at large.","Nanfang Ribao, Guangzhou, in Chinese",Guangdong,"Xiancheng Town, Chaoyang, Chaoyang, Shantou",4,200,"Student tuition: This reporter learned last evening from a pertinent department of Shantou City that Chaoyang City's Xiancheng Town on 11 February witnessed a malignant, well-organized, and premeditated incident of beating, smashing, looting, and burning the town government's office buildings under the pretext of student tuition problems.

193,5/22/01,Employee (China),Government (China),Demonstrate or rally,Shanxi Sheng,26081729,Workers in China's Liaoning Province Hold Demonstration,"??? According to information obtained by this center, over 1,000 workers of the Liaoyang City Ferroalloy Plant in Liaoning Province held a demonstration this morning in front of the city government building to protest against the court's action of forcibly taking away a lot of raw materials and other supplies from the plant. They requested that the city government do something for the livelihood of the plant's 8,000 workers. We have received confirmation of this demonstration from both the plant and the government department concerned.??? According to what we have learned, the above-mentioned plant, a state-owned enterprise, did pretty good business in the past. But, since the present plant manager took office five years ago, the plant has suffered losses due to improper management. As some workers of this plant told us, their leaders have frequently traveled abroad for sightseeing at the plant's expense, and it is their common practice to use the plant's money for feasting. Last year, with a loss as high as 1.05 billion yuan, the plant filed a petition to the court for bankruptcy. Before the issuance of the bankruptcy order, however, the court used dozens of trucks to carry away some 6,000 tons of raw materials and other supplies from the plant. This happened at 11 p.m. on 17 May. Even the head of the plant's Security Department, Chen Xin, had no previous information on this matter. The workers hold that the materials taken away by the court are the plant's property, which may be used as a source of funds for resettling the workers after they lose their jobs. Because of this, how to treat these materials should be decided by the workers rather than the court. During today's demonstration, the workers held banners reading: ""By forcibly taking the property away, court officials have committed the most heinous crime; violation of law by law enforcers cannot be tolerated by the state law."" ""Investigate the reason for the 1.05 billion yuan loss,"" and so forth. When the parade of the demonstrators passed by the court, they stopped there and shouted slogans. Then, the demonstrators came to the city government building. Several dozen of them, as representatives, went into the mayor's office to talk with him, while the other demonstrators dispersed. The representatives left by 3 p.m., according to the plant's guard on duty. A staff member of the plant also confirmed that upwards of 1,000 workers demonstrated in front of the city government building. ??? Last week a delegation from Liaoning Province arrived in Hong Kong to solicit investment. In the opinion of this center, the first thing to do in addressing Liaoning's economic problem is to solve the management problems, such as the corruption of the plant leaders, misuse of the plant's funds, and cronyism. If these problems are not solved, overseas investors will have no confidence in their investment in Liaoning.??? Currently, Liaoning's real unemployment rate is more than 20 percent. As a matter of fact, the above-mentioned plant has been unable to pay its workers for a year. After the plant's bankruptcy, its 8,000 workers (including retired workers) will face acute difficulty in obtaining a livelihood.???????

In 1999, Chongqing's Lifan Motorcar Group invested in the newspaper.?? As a result, its circulation steadily increased.?? Currently its circulation reached 200,000 copies, with handsome profits from advertisement.?? CPC authorities have always been afraid of the expansion of local privately run newspapers because the rapid growth of these newspapers in the market will lead to the loss of their public opinion front.?? Owing to these facts, they have always adopted a suppressive attitude.??? Since the beginning of this March, the Guangxi Regional CPC Committee has exerted pressure on ""Guangxi Shangbao,"" urging it to merge with ""Guangxi Ribao [Guangxi Newspaper].""?? Such a practice has caused great dissatisfaction at ""Guangxi Shangbao.""?? It resolutely refused to close and merge itself with ""Guangxi Ribao.""??? With the closure last month of ""Shu Bao [Shu Newspaper]"" and ""Shangwu Zaobao [Commercial Morning Newspaper]"" by the order of the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee, the Guangxi Regional CPC Committee immediately sent its personnel to Sichuan to learn from the experience gained in Sichuan Province.??? On 7 June, the Guangxi Regional CPC Committee suddenly announced that ""Guangxi Shangbao"" should be closed immediately.?? Meanwhile, 700 personnel of ""Guangxi Shangbao"" should wait for the Guangxi Regional CPC Committee to help them find another job.?? The closure order, like an earthquake, created quite a shock among the personnel of ""Guangxi Shangbao.""?? Being extremely unhappy, they decided to stage a demonstration in Nanning on 11 June.?? On the morning of 11 June, some responsible persons of the Guangxi Regional CPC Committee went to the newspaper office and tried to persuade the personnel of ""Guangxi Shangbao.""??

It has been learned by this center that Yan Peng, a well-known dissident in Shandong, was taken into custody as a criminal suspect by the public security bureau of Qingdao City on the morning of 14 July. His house was searched by the police. Yesterday 12 dissidents in the province published an open letter of protest, while three dissident representatives staged a sit-in demonstration in front of the Qingdao Public Security Bureau to protest against such persecution by the authorities right after Beijing had won the right to host the Olympic Games.??? According to what Yan Peng's wife, Zhong Xianye, told us, her husband was detained by the public security authorities at the Guangxi Customs on 11 July when he was going to Vietnam for sightseeing as a member of a tourist group. On 14 July, representatives of the Qingdao Public Security Bureau came to her house and told her that Yan Peng was formally put into criminal detention on the ""suspected charge of illegally leaving the country."" The public security personnel then searched her house and took away a computer and some other things. Learning of this, dissidents in Shandong were quite indignant. They opined that as Yan Peng had completed all legal procedures for his Vietnam tour and he was arrested in Guangxi, this was an obvious case in which the authorities framed a dissident with a trumped-up criminal charge. Yesterday morning, three dissidents in Qingdao, namely, Mu Chuanheng, Li Xielin, and Mu Xiaobo visited the Qingdao Public Security Bureau, but the personnel there refused to talk with them. To express their protest, they sat quietly at the gate of the public security bureau despite the broiling hot weather. Later, 12 dissidents issued an open letter to the international community, saying that the Chinese Communists had promised to improve the human rights situation when bidding for the Olympic Games, but persecuted a dissident right after obtaining the right to host the games. This is cheating the public of the international community, the letter concludes. Today, Mu Chuanheng and others have hired a lawyer for Yan Peng.??? Yan Peng, 38, took part in the 1989 democratic movement. He once ran a computer company and was one of the earliest dissidents using the Internet. He has helped many dissidents in this country to go on line and use the Internet. Because of this, he has been arrested several times by the public security authorities. ??? Before Beijing succeeded in its Olympic bid, a number of ""subversive cases"" originally scheduled to be tried shortly had been held up. Now that it has won the right to host the Olympic Games, these cases are expected to be tried one after another. According to our prediction, in August and September, 20 dissidents will be brought to trial on the charge of ""subverting the state power."" These 20 dissidents, including Li Wangyang, Yang Zili, Xu Wei, Huang Qi, Lu Xinhua, Wang Jinbo, and Hu Mingjun, may be given the heavy sentence of more than 10 years' imprisonment.??? Before voting for the Olympic host, many members of the International Olympic Committee believed that making Beijing the host city would help China improve its human rights situation. As this center views it, however, this is merely a wishful thinking. In reality, giving Beijing the right to host the Olympic Games can only beef up the Chinese Communists' one-party dictatorship, thereby making China's road to democracy even longer. The most fundamental reason that human rights are infringe upon in China is one-party dictatorship. This is because the Chinese Communists' basic purpose of suppressing dissidents is no other than preserving their one-party dictatorship.???

211,7/31/01,Tibet Autonomous Region,China,Demonstrate or rally,Qinghai Sheng,256507,"FEATURE-China puts infrastructure first in western push.","XINING, China, July 31 (Reuters) - Outside the gate of the Qinghai provincial government headquarters, more than 30 Tibetans stage a silent but futile protest against China's drive to develop its lagging western regions.The residents of rural Songduo county have travelled to the provincial capital Xining to protest against the seizure of their land in the name of the ""Great Western Development"" programme.""The government took our land and didn't give any reason,"" said one man sitting on the ground outside the government offices. ""What does western development mean? You tell me.""Almost two years after China launched the development push, new highways, bridges and tunnels have sprung up amid the scarred brown hills surrounding Xining.But China's emphasis on big projects and infrastructure works has failed to improve the lives of many.For the farmers and herders of Qinghai, which borders Tibet, average income was 1,490 yuan ($180) last year, two-thirds of the national level for rural households with little growth from 1999.Qinghai has won three major projects in the programme - a $2.4 billion railway to Tibet, a $338 million potash fertiliser plant and a $300 million natural gas pipeline stretching 950 km (590 miles) to Lanzhou.None of the projects is finished yet.""For Tibetan people, it's health, it's education, it's skills training, it's not big infrastructure projects, which facilitate more Han Chinese people moving into the area,"" said Alison Reynolds, director of the London-based Free Tibet Campaign rights group.""They (Han Chinese) have more skills than Tibetans so will always be better placed to benefit from the employment opportunities that arise,"" she said.CHINA'S TRANSPORT WOESChina will invest $13 billion in Qinghai's infrastructure in the next five years with funding earmarked for more highways and three new airports, officials said.More basic infrastructure is needed before a wave of prosperity can wash over western regions, which lag far behind booming eastern provinces, they said.""Transport is the basis of economic development,"" said vice mayor of Qinghai's Golmud city, Xia Jiaxiang.Chinese companies say the biggest problems for operating in the west are the big distances and high transport costs.For Qinghai Salt Lake Industry Co, builder of the new potash fertiliser plant, it takes up to seven days to ship products to markets in southern and eastern China by truck and rail.Salt Lake's freight charges are $20 a tonne, taking the price of its potash fertiliser to around $115, not much less than the same product shipped all the way from Canada.Officials of Golmud Oil Refinery, a branch of industry giant PetroChina Co, said the new railway to Tibet would lower costs and increase demand for its crude and oil products.""After the economy develops, market demand will grow and we will benefit,"" said Miao Geng, the refinery's vice director.Golmud vice mayor Xia said the railway alone would create 50,000 jobs and swell the population of the western boomtown to 350,000 from the current 200,000.That is what worries human rights groups. Ethnic Tibetans account for only 21 percent of Qinghai's 4.95 million population and that ratio is shrinking.""UNIVERSITY INFRASTRUCTURE""Analysts say western regions desperately need infrastructure but China should not neglect education, medical care and other programmes to help improve people's daily lives.It could take a decade for the western development drive to show results, they say.When China announced the first batch of western development projects last year, six involved transport, although the building of ""university infrastructure"" was part of the plan.""Clearly an investment in people, in education, is probably the best investment any government can make,"" said Bruce Murray, representative for the Asian Development Bank in China.""So more money clearly has to go into things like education and health to balance off the other investments in infrastructure and the environment.""In Qinghai, the one environmental protection initiative is a scheme to stop farmers from growing rape and barley - a staple food crop - in exchange for 90 kg (200 lb) of grain and $2.40 in cash for every one-fifteenth of a hectare (0.17 acre).The plan to turn farmland into grassland because of overgrazing and rapid population growth has faced opposition from producers, who want more compensation.""It's not enough, but what can I do,"" said Tibetan herdsman San Cheng Jia from his house on the fertile shores of Qinghai Lake. ""If we plant more grass, I can raise more sheep and yaks. Beyond that, I don't know what western development means.""($1=8.277 Yuan).",Reuters,Qinghai,Xining,2,30,"""The government took our land and didn't give any reason,"" said one man sitting on the ground outside the government offices.

According to witnesses, two protesters were taken away after clashing with police. The municipal government confirmed the demonstration to us. Separately, the noted dissident Han Lifa was taken from his home by police prior to the APEC meeting. It is expected that he will be confined in a hotel during the APEC meetings.It has been learned that the main reason for the demonstration in front of the municipal government was that the protesters were dissatisfied with the government's relocation policy and re-building plan. The protesters are all from the Fushansuo relocation zone. Residents of the zone were relocated three years ago. The Weidong Real Estate Development Company was tasked with rebuilding the zone.Prior to their relocation, the municipal government had promised thousands of residents that after rebuilding, new residential quarters would be greener and not have many business facilities. But in reality, after rebuilding the zone, it has neither green nor public places for outdoor activities, but does have many business facilities. So the residents don't want to move back to the new residential quarters due to the bad environment.Starting yesterday, several hundred residents came to the municipal government to protest, and today there were about 500 people blocking the east gate of the municipal government. More than 50 policemen were sent to the scene by the authorities, and two protesters were taken away after clashes with police. The guard at the east gate of the municipal government confirmed that there were about 500 demonstrators in the morning at the seat of the municipal government, but left at noon.At present, the worker's protests and the relocation residents' protests are the two main origins of the city's demonstrations. The protest against relocation is related to conflicts of interest that arise from every quarter, mostly because officials collude with developers to satisfy developers in the cost of relocating residents.The APEC meeting will start soon. Shanghai's police have begun to control dissidents strictly. Yesterday afternoon at three o'clock the prominent dissident Han Lifa was taken from his home by three policemen from the Yangpu branch of Shanghai Public Security Bureau. Police told Han's family afterwards that Han would be held in a hotel for a period of time.No outside contact can be made with Han, so it is unknown in which hotel he is confined. It is expected that he will be released only after the APEC meeting ends. Han is one of the founders of China Democratic Party in Shanghai. He was sentenced to three years reform through labour in 1999 and got released this July. Recently, Shanghai police have strengthened control over dissidents in Shanghai. In 1998 prior to Clinton's visit to Shanghai, more than 10 dissidents were confined to a hotel or forced to travel to other places accompanied by police. It is expected the same thing will happen this time.Telephone: Han Lifa: 21-65410275 East gate of Qingdao Municipal Government: 532-5911139 Protesters: 532-5911610Source: Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, Hong Kong, in Chinese 15 Oct 01.",Hong Kong Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy,Shandong,Qingdao,2,500,Five hundred Qingdao residents staged a protest against government policy on their relocation and two protesters were taken away after clashing with police.

According to official figures, at least 100,000 people in Henan were infected with the AIDS virus after selling blood from the mid-1980's until the mid-1990's to boost their meager income. ??? They contracted the disease because health officials in Henan allowed blood stations using unsanitary blood-collecting methods to operate. ??? Independent Chinese doctors estimate the number of infected are much higher, and could easily be more than 500,000. ??? Most of the cases occurred in small villages like Wenlou where knowledge of the disease is scant and villagers were poor and desperate for money. ??? The Chinese government initially responded to the crisis with silence and inaction, but following media reports it finally admitted the problem late last year. ??? Local governments have opened a free clinic in Wenlou village, while stationing police there 24-hours a day to keep journalists out and to monitor villagers' actions. ??? But villagers said the clinic provides only basic medicine. As they watch family members and fellow villagers die in high numbers, many have begun demanding the government do more. ??? Many also suspect the medicine provided by the clinic is fake. ??? ""We want medicine that will make the fever go away,"" Chen said. ???

All we could do was stand around on the street,"" said the 68-year-old worker.CROWDED SECTORBeijing Automobile Works once belonged to a state-owned conglomerate responsible for China's first joint venture, Beijing Jeep. That 1983 merger between Beijing Automotive Industry and the former American Motors Corp was inherited by Chrysler in 1987 and DaimlerChrysler in 1998.The Beijing Jeep venture took the quality assets of the factory where Wednesday's protests flared, and the plant was reorganised as a separate car and motorcycle factory.Production dwindled in the crowded sector, however, and was recently halted ahead of its imminent shutdown, said an official.""Our production has been suspended and we are in the process of taking apart the plant,"" she told Reuters.About 5,000 still employed by the plant were facing forced early retirement or possible layoffs, workers said.The elderly women said they could not comprehend how a firm once tied to what was once China's most prominent joint venture could leave its veterans in the lurch.""The company was profitable for many years and we had a lot to do with that,"" said the 68-year-old worker. ""Then all of the sudden there was nothing.""The 70-year-old, weakened by diabetes, described a vicious cycle of sickness and poverty.""When we were young, we endured hardship and exhaustion at the factory, and now we are old and sick,"" she said.""But they don't give any welfare for us to live on, so we get sicker. And then when we buy our medicines they don't reimburse us,"" she said.HOMES SEARCHEDGrowing discontent among retrenched workers has highlighted China's concerns over social stability in the sensitive run-up to a leadership transition late this year, when senior officials including President Jiang Zemin are due to step down from their Communist Party posts.In China's northeastern rustbelt, thousands of protesters have demonstrated in the city of Liaoyang and the oil town of Daqing in recent weeks, although both centres were quiet on Wednesday.A laid-off worker from Liaoning's Ferroalloy Factory said workers there were planning a new demonstration on Thursday after a two-day break.""The elderly retirees among us are really tired and they need some rest,"" the worker said.Four labour leaders detained by police for their role in the Liaoyang protests remained in custody.

The farmers squatted outside the headquarters of the Beijing People's Congress -- the city's legislature -- for several hours, taking up almost the entire sidewalk outside the government building.?? ??? There is a growing trend in China toward carrying out such protests, which get almost immediate reaction from a government wary of social unrest, and away from repeated individual appeals for help, which often go nowhere.?? ???

The farmers form a farming collective, and compensation has been paid to the village government for use on village-related services, such as road repairs and factory construction, he said.?? ??? Liu said money has been paid to village officials, but farmers counter they should be entitled to some individual compensation since land repossession has resulted in a loss of livelihood.?? ??? ""Many people are scraping by doing odd jobs in the city, but even when we try to sell a little something, like fireworks, to earn money, they fine us,"" another villager said.?? ???

These extremely disgruntled workers had several times staged demonstrations in front of the government building of Datong city and even sent representatives to Beijing to hold a demonstration.?? On 20 May, the coal mine company agreed to hold consultations with workers, but it adopted hard-line attitude without making concessions after workers had arrived at the company.?? Hence, angry workers blocked Maogan highway connecting Datong city and the coal mines.

Workers held that Shengli Petroleum did not provide sufficient compensation fees and buy social insurance for them. Against this, they have been staging demonstrations and blocking several streets near the management bureau of Shengli Petroleum and in Dongying city since 17 June, and to date, nearly 1,000 people are still demonstrating. The labour union and the labour management bureau under the management bureau have confirmed the demonstration to us. This is another national oil workers demonstration following the demonstration held by Daqing oil workers.We have learnt that Shengli Petroleum, headquartered in Dongying city, Shandong province, is the second largest oil field in China with annual oil output of approximately 30m tonnes. Since June 2001, through ""terminating labour contracts by agreement"", Shengli Petroleum has laid off 21,000 workers. These workers' compensation fees are based on their length of service with one year standing compensated for 4,100 yuan, and workers' all relations with ""Shengli Petroleum Ltd Company"" are severed after they are laid off. The laid-off workers have disagreements with Shengli Petroleum in the following three fields. 1) Workers call on Shengli Petroleum to buy social insurance for them, and the annual average insurance fees for one person must reach around 2,000 yuan. 2) Workers demand jobs. 3) Some workers hold that the compensation fees are fairly low. Owing to the disagreements, workers have started blocking some streets and have been staging a demonstration in front of the management bureau since 17 June, and the number of workers has reached nearly 2,000 at most. The labour management bureau and the labour union under the management bureau have confirmed to us that there were nearly 1,000 people demonstrating this morning. According to the staff with the labour management bureau, these workers have no relations with Shengli Petroleum after their contracts are terminated so that the company will not need to buy social insurance for them. With regard to their employment problems, they should get their unemployment certificates from the government of Dongying city and call on the government to solve their re-employment problems. In the opinion of the labour management bureau, ""terminating labour contracts by agreement"" has been in effect since early June so the 2,100 workers have no relations with Shengli Petroleum. This is another oil workers demonstration following a demonstration staged by Daqing oil workers in March.Source: Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, Hong Kong, in Chinese 20 Jun 02.",Hong Kong Information Center for Human Rights & Democracy in Chinese,Shandong,Shengli Petroleum in Shandong Province,1,21000,

Recently, 20,000 people in Shaodong County, Hunan Province, stormed into the county government and county party committee buildings and recklessly destroyed things in the buildings, evolving into the most serious incident of people storming the government in recent history of China. The incident has led to the dismissal of five officials, including secretary of the county party committee, but the incident is not completely over yet as there are still repercussions to this date. ??? The incident of 20,000 people storming into the office of county party committee in Shaodong County, Hunan, was caused by the following happenings. Shaodong County is a major economic county in Hunan Province. It is a transit as well as wholesale centerunan, H???? of various kinds of supplies. Therefore, cargo-shipping business has been very developed in the county. In the past, Shaodong County's shipping business was handled by individual residents who made quite big profits as shippers or shipping managers. Of course, because of the lack of effective management, the shipping business is fraught with problems. Contradictions between shipper and manager, between shipper and transporter, and between manager and transporter often lead to scuffles. In the meantime, it became very difficult for the government to collect tax. In order to solve these problems, Shaodong County Government decided to implement an effective management of the county's shipping businesses by having them concentrated in one locality. At the same time, it reissued the license for shipping operators. This has affected the interests of many people. ??? Officials should exercise utmost caution when dealing with civil cases??? People connected with the shipping businesses say, the county government did this because it could give the government an excuse to glean an extra income from these businesses. The operators of these businesses already paid a fee for the license to run them, now they had to pay for it again. Also, the fact they were all confined within the same locality further intensified the contests between them and made them more vulnerable to scuffles and clashes. Therefore, these people decided to go to the county government to get an explanation. Originally, they planned to gather a few hundred people for the protest. If the county government handled the case in an appropriate way, the situation would not have gone out of control. What the Shaodong County Government did was resorting to a brutal method by ordering armed police to arrest the protestors. This incurred the great wrath of the masses. Many people joined the protesters' ranks and began to beat the armed police. Under this circumstance, the armed police retreated into the compound of the county government and county people's congress to take refugee there. Consequently, more than 20,000 people stormed into the compound. At the time, the secretary of county party committee and other county leaders, afraid they might be beaten by the angry masses, avoided to have direct dialogue with them. Thus, the riot broke out. The angry masses turned over all of a dozen or so vehicles parked in the compound. Some of the masses, shouting at the top of their voices, even wanted to set fire to the cars. Fortunately, they were stopped by the cool-minded among the masses, thus preventing the incident from getting more serious. But what followed was still more horrible. No longer able to control their own emotions, many of the masses stormed into the offices of the county government and people's congress where they smashed to smithereens all office equipment including desks, chairs and computers. They also smashed all glasses in the offices and the office buildings, bringing an immense challenge to the controlling authority of the Shaodong County Government. This gave a severe shock to the Hunan Provincial Government, which immediately took action to dismiss the five principal officials directly responsible for leadership, including the secretary of the county party committee, and have them prosecuted. To ease the tense situation for the time being, it did not immediately arrest those who led the masses in destroying government facilities. But it can be certain those who took the lead in creating the disturbances will be investigated and prosecuted at an appropriate time. At the same time, concentrated control of the shipping businesses was also temporarily suspended.??? Officials should raise the level of their own management????????????????????????????????? ??? This incident shows that the grassroots officials in China are at a very low level in their administrative management. For the time being let's not talk about whether the county government was intent on making profit from the shipping industry. But what the county government should have done before it put this policy into effect is to fully solicit people's opinions in order to formulate an effective policy that gives even consideration to the interests of all sides, rather than formulating an one-sided policy according to its own taste and own interests without giving any thought to the interests of the masses.?? ??? Speaking from another angle, the government should have a crisis warning system which will make it possible for the grassroots level units to react immediately to the signal of a crisis to dissipate it. What is even more worthy of mentioning is that officials at all levels in China should exercise extreme caution in dealing with a crisis, instead of resorting to very brutal means that pay no respect to human rights and will only pour oil over the flames. ??? If the Shaodong County Government could see that it was dealing with very indignant masses and government leaders could appear in public to have a direct dialogue with the masses, the trouble would be reduced to the minimum and the crisis would be dispelled. Instead, the county's principal leaders took to ordering armed police to arrest people and made the contradictions become more intense. A crisis which could have been avoided became even more serious and the incident developed out of hand. Officials at various levels in China should draw a profound lesson from this incident. They should realize that the masses are no longer the masses of more than a decade ago when they would say yes to their every suggestion and were timid and overcautious. The common people in present day China are no longer afraid of government officials. Those who are of higher educational background will use law as weapon to sue the government at various levels and there are frequent cases of officials being sued by the common people. Those of lower educational background would take violent actions against the government's wrong policies. Therefore, it is obviously pressing for officials at various levels to raise the level of their own administrative management.???????????

302,9/17/02,Employee (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Gansu Sheng,25357308,HK-based Labor Rights Web Site on Worker Protest in Sichuan,"??? By mid-August, retrenched workers at COEDC took up collective action demanding the following:??? -- unemployment allowance ??? -- adjusting the premium for their pensions; and ??? -- job placement or reinstatement for retrenched young workers.??? Failing to reach any agreement, about 800 workers started to stage sit-in protests outside the COEDC building on September 2. Since then, approximately 500-600 retrenched workers have been maintaining the sit-in protests every day.??? According to COEDC workers, the organisers put up banners and posters appealing to their fellow workers to sign up for collective litigation against Sichuan Petroleum Administrative Bureau (Sichuan PAB) and its subsidiaries. The workers believe they have legal grounds under Chinese Labour Law and Contract law since they were forced into signing the retrenchment agreement, and that the court should rule the agreement invalid. To prepare for legal action, the organisers started to raise funds to cover legal fees.??? The action sent the company into alert. A worker at Chuandong Development Company, another subsidiary of Sichuan PAB, told CLB that on the morning of September 2, COEDC management reported to the police, saying that Falungong members were making trouble outside their office. Arriving at the scene, the police stopped the fundraising activities right away and attempted to make arrests. Outraged by the police action, hundreds of workers surrounded the police for 11 hours. The workers finally allowed the police to depart when the public security authorities in Jiangbei District apologised to the workers for the arbitrary arrests and promised that it would not happen again.??? Further information obtained by CLB confirmed that as many as 4,000 workers from Sichuan PAB subsidiaries -- including Meter Repair Factory, Development Company, Drilling & Exploration, Well Logging Company and Main Desulphurisation Factory -- joined the sit-in on September 3. Around 500 workers were still protesting outside COEDC office on September 16, and the fundraising activities are still on going.??? The workers' actions in Chongqing grew out of a situation similar to the 3-month protests of Daqing oil workers, which began last March. One of the retrenched workers acknowledged that they had been receiving information on the Daqing workers protests through various channels, and that they had been inspired and encouraged by these workers' bold actions. He said, ""The workers here view the courage ????????????????... of the Daqing workers with great admiration. We think that [they] have earned respect for Chinese workers. Chinese workers are grateful to the workers in Daqing."" He went on to say, ""The workers here wouldn't have had the idea and the courage to organise ourselves if not for the actions taken by Daqing workers in March.""??? Like the Daqing workers, COEDC oil workers were cheated into signing the retrenchment agreement. Another retrenched worker described how they were forced to accept the retrenchment arrangement introduced in November 1999. He recalled that the management warned them of the consequences of not accepting the package -- they would simply be laid off if the company experienced financial problems, and they would only get small stipends of living allowance. Threatened by the bleak prospect, COEDC workers were left with no choice but to sign the 'agreement'.??? CLB called the parent company, Sichuan PAB, in Chengdu for their response to the protest action. We were told that soon after the protest, the department chief in charge of wage matters was sent to discuss the matter with the Chongqing municipal government. According to Sichuan PAB there were two main issues in question. First of all, Sichuan PAB had contributed to the unemployment insurance fund under the Sichuan provincial administration. They had no idea how the fund was managed after Chongqing broke away from the province as a municipal administrative unit, the Wages Department of Sichuan PAB said. Secondly, PAB felt the retrenched workers should be regarded as unemployed, a point dismissed by the Chongqing municipal government.??? China Labour Bulletin supports COEDC workers' action demanding their rights to pensions and employment. We also support their attempt to take up legal action in accordance with the Chinese Labour Law, Trade Union Law and Contract Law. CLB offers all possible assistance to COEDC workers in their legal fight.??? CLB has often reported on the unjust and unfair treatment inflicted on the Chinese workers over the past twenty years of economic reforms. Mass workers' protests in Daqing, Liaoyang and Sichuan send a clear message that the Chinese government's iron-fisted approach to workers???????????????? concerns deny them the freedom of association but has not killed the workers' will to fight for their legitimate rights.[Description of Source: Hong Kong Chung Kuo Lao Kung Tung Hsun WWW-Text in English -- web site, also known as China Labour Bulletin, founded by noted labor activist Han Dongfang, providing information on labor issues and activity in China, including efforts by workers to organize outside of party-controlled labor organizations.??

He said the protesters disbanded after an official in the provincial party office agreed to give farmers a reply in three days.??? Residents of several of the villages joined the demonstration, which party employees confirmed took place but with many fewer participants than claimed by the farmers.??? The problem faced by the Yanta farmers is not an unusual one in China, where the government -- or developers in collusion with government officials -- decides unilaterally how much money to compensate residents whose property they want to tear down for redevelopment projects.??? In Yanta, officials conspired with real estate developers to pay farmers as little as 400 yuan (48 dollars) per square meter (1.25 square yard) of land they were claiming for construction, the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy had said.??? New housing in the area can fetch five times as much, making for a huge profit for businesses involved, according to the center.??? Zhang said farmers were also upset because the government refuses to compensate them for the destruction of wells and grave sites.??? Although compensation terms for the farmers have yet to be resolved, the government has already begun dispatching crews to destroy orchards and farmland to make way for the construction.??? Four residents of Miaopotou village were beaten by a group of about 30 security guards sent by the developer in a skirmish over the unearthing of a coffin at a gravesite, Zhang said.??? Among the four was an elderly woman who remains hospitalized.??

""Persecuting HIV-positive protestors is doubly outrageous given that the state was complicit in their infection in the first place,"" said Joanne Csete, director of HRW's HIV/AIDS and Human Rights Program.???

The local police chief, three officers and 10 villagers were hurt, the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said.It quoted an unidentified government official as saying that villagers also smashed windows in the government office building.Thirteen villagers were sentenced by the Yutai County Court on Oct. 30 to between one and four years in jail on charges of disturbing social order and interfering with government work, the Hong Kong-based center said.Daxuecun's 1,300 residents were moved off their land in February before work had even begun on new homes and were forced to live in tents made of plastic sheeting, the center said.The work isn't scheduled for completion until April, it said, making it likely that villagers will have to endure Shandong's freezing winter in their temporary shelters.Many villagers were also angry at receiving new farm plots that totaled only half the size of their original fields and believed officials were skimming funds from their compensation package, the Hong Kong-based group said.Prosecutor Niu Fuchang said the charges and sentences were related to attacks on police, but said he couldn't discuss details. Court officials also confirmed the sentences, but declined to discuss the case further.The protest was among a wave of actions underscoring deep discontent with demolition and relocation projects that critics say often amount to little more than corrupt land grabs.Throughout China, urban residents are being moved by the millions to make way for new office and apartment buildings. Farmers, especially near the growing cities of eastern China, frequently lose their land to industrial zones or housing projects.Shandong, one of China's most densely populated provinces, has witnessed several recent incidents of mass unrest, most recently a riot last month in which 1,000 demonstrators stormed government offices to protest the death of a vendor they say was deliberately run over by officials.At least 100 people were arrested by 800 police officers in the riot in the city of Zou. The violence took place Oct. 28, one day after city officials confiscated the vendor's cooking utensils."

436,9/10/04,Activist (China),Police (China),Demonstrate or rally,Beijing Shi,4637399,Petitioning Beijing --- Police Greet With Force Sea of People Airing Local Grievances  ,"Beijing -- CHINESE POLICE are resorting to violent tactics to cope with the growing number of protesters who show up in the capital each day, highlighting stress fractures in a national justice system ill-equipped for China's transformation into a capitalist society.A continuing police campaign to sweep thousands of petitioners out of the capital ahead of a key meeting of Communist Party leaders next week has surprised human-rights activists for its scale, duration and tactics. The activists allege that police are using electric batons and tranquilizers to shepherd people onto buses to be taken home.Even before the campaign started a week ago, sporadic confrontations between police and petitioners have resulted in violence. Witnesses say that in one incident last month they saw an old man throttled to death by officers at the Supreme Court. The Wall Street Journal has submitted questions to the government about that assertion.As petitioners are ferried out of the capital, others continue to arrive in search of redress for unresolved conflicts with provincial governments.The pilgrimages to Beijing are a serious side effect of a judiciary that enjoys little independence from the ruling Communist Party -- a system that makes it hard for plaintiffs to receive fair hearings in local courts over matters such as corruption, land seizures, excessive taxation and unpaid wages. The result is a stream of people who, like their Confucian forebears during imperial times, journey higher and higher up the government bureaucracy in search of a righteous official who will hear their complaints and deliver justice.That a country should face a rise in popular protests amid wrenching economic changes is hardly surprising. ""But what is more unique to China is the unavailability of legal avenues for people to express their anger,"" says Murray Scot Tanner, a specialist on Chinese politics and law enforcement at Rand Corp, a research organization based in California. ""One of the best ways to bring attention to your cause is to yue ji -- to take your protest to a higher level.""The official tactics used to deal with the crowds of petitioners outside central government offices challenge expectations that China's new leaders will be more tolerant of dissent than their predecessors. Outside the government's main appeals office on a recent morning, scores of official vans and cars from more than a dozen provinces sat waiting to retrieve detained petitioners, some of whom were dragged to the vehicles by uniformed and plainclothes police.In a statement released Thursday, New York-based Human Rights in China cited petitioners who said they were beaten, prodded with electric wands, and held in a sports stadium before being shipped out of the city. The group said police from the northeastern city of Benxi, Liaoning Province, drugged the food they offered their detainees before loading them into paddy wagons and taking them to detention centers back in their provinces.""Recently we have been notified several times by higher-ups that we should retrieve petitioners from Benxi,"" said an official reached by phone at the Benxi appeals office. He added: ""I haven't heard of using drugs"" to knock people out.Human Rights in China said some 36,000 people have been removed from the capital since the start of the campaign, though people who have witnessed the crackdown say it is impossible to gauge whether the number is that high.A policeman at Youanmen police station, which is involved in the campaign, said ""We have organized several petitioner sweeps under the guidance of the Beijing Public Security Bureau's General Security Team. Now we are seeing fewer petitioners than before."" He declined to say how many had been taken away.Whatever the figure, central government authorities have admitted publicly that the number of petitioners trying to make it to the capital is increasing. These petitioners are the spillover of local protests around the country that are rising in number by at least 9% each year since 1993, to 58,000 protests last year, according to published public security data cited by Mr. Tanner of Rand.There aren't any indications that such protests, increasing though they might be, pose a threat to the Communist Party's grip on power. ""A sense of perspective is necessary,"" says Mr. Tanner. ""There is still no nationwide independent political party in China, no nationwide trade union, student union, peasant association, or religious group. Nothing.""",NA,Beijing,,7,36000,"Petition:  around dozens of provinces.  ~9/16 Human Rights in China has estimated that about 36,000 petitioners who came to Beijing to air their grievances ahead of the plenum have been detained.  thousands of petitioners out of the capital ahead of a key meeting of Communist Party leaders next week.

According to a source, the local government made an unexpected announcement in March 2002 to designate the 20,000-mu forest land in Sanchawan Village and several villages near it as ""economic development zone"" and prescribed a compensation of 500 yuan per mu of land for peasants' labor service.?? It also invited investment and fixed the price of the land as 350,000 yuan per mu.?? Eighty percent of the forest land has been transferred to development agencies, and?? 40 percent of it has been destroyed.??? Local peasants maintain that the land is collective land and not what the government regards as ""state-owned land"" and therefore reject the compensation program of the authorities.?? In addition, villagers doubt that the local government has legal documents to prove the approvals of the central and provincial authorities to the development zone.?? The development zone is actually a government-run company and has the problem of corruption.?? The government has also gone back on its promise of allocating land for peasants to build residential houses on many occasions.[Description of Source: Hong Kong Ping Kuo Jih Pao (Internet Version-WWW) in Chinese -- Internet version of non-PRC-owned daily newspaper (""Apple Daily""); contains features on and analysis of PRC and Hong Kong political, social, and economic issues.

458,12/20/04,Citizen (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Beijing Shi,6012917,Chinese protest in Beijing against ex-Taiwan leader's planned Japan visit  ,"Text of report by Ralph Jennings, carried in English by Japanese news agency KyodoBeijing, 20 December: About 30 people demonstrated outside the Japanese embassy in Beijing with flags, banners and slogans Monday [20 December] afternoon to protest Japan's plan to give former Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui a visa and to air discontent over other Sino-Japanese political issues. The demonstrators, mostly men in their 20s and 30s organized by a citizens group called the Patriots Alliance Network, stood at the embassy gates for about half an hour as 12 police cars blocked off the street.Protesters, some of whom have staged other anti-Japan demonstrations in Beijing, carried five banners, two flags and bullhorns or battery-powered microphones to shout their messages, most of which were read from a prepared three-page speech. ""This is another case of interference in China's internal affairs and its support for Taiwan independence,"" protest leader Zhang Jianyou said. ""In recent days, Taiwan separatist Lee Teng-hui, using the excuse of 'sightseeing in Japan,' has asked the Japanese government to grant a visa and has even received the Japanese government's approval in principle,"" he said, reading from the speech. ""As Chinese citizens, we express the utmost anger.""Zhang, voice breaking, and other demonstrators shouted, ""Resist the Japanese government"" and ""Persist in opposing Taiwan independence."" Although the shades were drawn in most embassy offices facing the protest, a staff member with the embassy's culture and education section stepped out momentarily with her Chinese interpreter to acknowledge the protest. The embassy plans to write a report about the activity for the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo.On Friday, Lee Teng-hui applied for a Japanese visa in Taipei. He would visit Nagoya, Kyoto, Kanazawa and Tokyo for five days beginning 27 December. Japan says Lee, 81, a Kyoto University graduate and fluent Japanese speaker, wants to go as a tourist. China's Foreign Ministry says Lee, Taiwan's Kuomintang president from 1988-2000 and an advocate for more distance between Taiwan and China, cannot be seen to visit without a tie to politics and asked Japan to reject the visa. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that must eventually reunite or face use of force.The protesters also brought up Japanese leaders' talk of discontinuing official development aid to China, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visits to Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo and territorial conflicts in the East China Sea, where both countries want to explore for gas under the ocean floor. Banners read: ""Strongly object to Japan's rude interference in Chinese internal affairs"" and, referring to World War II, ""Don't forget the insult to the nation - resist Japanese products.""Zhang said Chinese Foreign Ministry officials had tried lately to improve Sino-Japanese relations, but Japanese leaders had undone those ties. He also declined to speak with Japanese media after the protest, describing Japanese media reports on Chinese affairs as ""eight layers of dung"". ""Lee is definitely going to carry out separatist activities (in Japan),"" he told other reporters. Ushered by police, who knew about the demonstration in advance, the demonstrators marched away from the embassy at about 2.15 p.m. [local time] singing the Chinese national anthem.Source: Kyodo News Service, Tokyo, in English 1020 gmt 20 Dec 04","Kyodo News Service, Tokyo, in English",Beijing,Japanese embassy,9,30,

There were clashes in the ensuring confrontation between the police and the workers, with a number of people being arrested.?? Up until yesterday [19 Dec], the incident was still not over yet.?? It is understood that the incident was chiefly set off by the change in factory system, as well as the embezzlement and bribe-taking on the part of factory leaders, which brought the state-owned enterprise, which formerly had 5,000-plus workers and staff members and several billion yuan in assets, to the brink of bankruptcy, unable to pay wages for months.It has been learned that the state-owned enterprise where the trouble occurred is Luzhou City's Huoju (Torch) Chemical Group, the predecessor of a military industrial enterprise.?? The protest incident began last Wednesday evening (15 December), with large numbers of workers confining the factory leaders to the factory club.?? It was not until for o'clock early the next morning, while the workers were paying no attention, that the leaders succeeded in escaping.?? Several days later, more than 3,000 workers gathered at the main gate of the new factory area to stage a protest demonstration, calling on factory management to pay back wages and investigate corruption on the part of leaders, but the Luzhou authorities failed to promptly deal with the incident.?? As a result, some people adopted relatively radical measures, such as blocking traffic in the streets, giving rise to several hours of traffic jam on the highway between factory buildings and the downtown area.?? On the third day of the incident, in the name of keeping order the local government called up nearly 1,000 antiriot policemen to clear the area and, in the ensuing confrontation, there was a free fight for some time between the two sides.[Description of Source: Hong Kong Ming Pao (Internet Version-WWW) in Chinese -- Internet version of well-respected, non-PRC-owned daily newspaper; contains well-informed features on and analysis of PRC and Hong Kong political, social, and economic issues.??

Nearly the whole village turned up to protest,"" she told AFP, declining to be named.A nurse at the Dongyang City People's Hospital said between 70 and 80 people, mostly police and officials, were treated for injuries on Sunday. About 30 of them remained hospitalised, she said.The worker said there were at least ""several thousand"" people involved in the clash, while a local police officer estimated there were nearly 10,000 demonstrators.The police officer denied that anyone had died however. More than 300 police were mobilised to handle the protest, she added.""People were throwing rocks ... [ellipses as received] it was chaotic and many people got injured,"" she said.An industrial estate was built in Huashui in 2001 and locals are against the construction of another chemical factory on the site, according to the Beijing-based Friends of Nature's website.They claim factories operating there spew toxic wastes and emissions into the water supply which has resulted in ruined crops and deformity among new-born babies.""The folks are just worried that the poisonous chemicals would pose too much harm to them -- their vegetables won't grow and no one would want to marry the boys and girls from our village,"" the worker said.China has witnessed a slew of violent demonstrations over the past few months, often the result of large-scale constructions which are fuelling the country's economic boom.Farmland is often requisitioned against residents' wishes.Many local officials, often eyeing gains from lucrative land sales, collaborate with businesses and property developers to build industrial parks and factories, often without compensating local residents adequately.Last October, tens of thousands of people clashed with armed police in a string of protests over the building of the Pubugou Dam in the southwestern province of Sichuan.Around the same time, ethnic unrest broke out between Muslims and the Han majority in central province of Henan where at least seven people were killed.Last weekend, tens of thousands of anti-Japanese demonstrators took to the streets to protest Tokyo's decision to approve a new school textbook which China says glosses over Japanese wartime atrocities.[Description of Source: Hong Kong AFP in English -- Hong Kong service of the independent French press agency Agence France-Presse]",Hong Kong AFP in English,Zhejiang,"Huashui township, Dongyang city in Zhejiang province.Wangkantou",5,30000,"Chemical plants:  http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/5/4/12/n885871.htm     4/12:   A village in Dongyang, Zhejiang province, erupted in a massive riot on Sunday when over 30,000 villagers clashed with police who were disrupting a protest against pollution.Reports that police had killed some of the elderly women protesters sparked the chaos in Hua Xi village in Dongyang. More than 50 government vehicles, including 14 cars and at least 40 buses, were turned over and destroyed. A total of 128 people were sent to the hospital for treatment, and 36 were admitted for longer-term care.One resident told the South China Morning Post that police officers, armed with clubs and shields, tried to disperse the group of elderly women, firing tear gas.""They arrived at the sheds at about 5am and began dispersing the women. A number of the women passed out after they were hit with electrified clubs... They just hit the elderly women,"" said the resident.

The casualties could not be confirmed.Some protesters were whisked off by police cars.For about a month, the 200 elderly protesters had been staging an around-the clock vigil outside the Hua Xi Middle School, not far from an industrial zone.

They lived in makeshift bamboo sheds they had erected.On Sunday morning, rumours quickly spread that at least one of the protesters had been killed, sparking a rush by 30,000 to 40,000 villagers to the site, the witness said. ""This is like almost all of the town's population was there,"" he said.Residents said since the 13 chemical plants were erected in 2001, the pollution had affected the environment so badly that the soil was barren and local vegetables inedible. ""The turnip's skin is white, but it's dark inside,"" said one resident who took part in the riot.Villagers had to give up farming and earn a living by working at small trades, he said. ""At the beginning, there was just one factory; now there are about 13 of them. We complained to the city government, asking for the relocation of either the factories or the village, but got no response.""One official even said the factories would remain there even if all the people in the village died,"" he said.""Young people didn't dare [join the original protest], since if they did, they would have been immediately harassed,"" the resident said, explaining why most of the protesters were elderly.Dongyang government spokesman Chen Qixian last night denied that anyone was killed when the protest was broken up. He said 1,000 government officials, including at least 100 policemen, were used in the operation.An informed source said mainland media had been restricted from reporting sensitive news about Zhejiang for fear that it would discourage foreign investment in the coastal province, which has seen extensive investments from overseas, Hong Kong and Taiwan in recent years.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post (Internet Version-WWW) in English -- Internet version of Hong Kong's most prominent non-PRC-owned English-language daily newspaper.

The attackers clashed with police, but tensions were reduced as some people yelled ""Chinese don't beat Chinese."" No arrests were reported, except for several Hong Kong and Japanese media workers who were taken away for questioning and then later released.Japanese officials based in Beijing said some cars parked inside the Shenyang consular were damaged by the attackers.Earlier reports said thousands of people, mostly college and university students, were dispersed as they gathered at a shopping mall in Shenyang. Those who were not daunted then marched to Japan's consulate general, where they put up anti-Japanese banners and called on the public to boycott Japanese products.In southern China, thousands of protesters shouted ""Boycott Japanese products"" slogans in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province as anti-Japanese protests took place there for the third Sunday in a row.Holding banners condemning Japan's glossing over of its wartime atrocities in newly published history textbooks, the protesters waved Chinese flags and sang their national anthem as they marched toward Shennan Road, where Japanese-invested department stores were targeted.Police were seen making way for the protesters while also containing them to ""designated areas"" for the march. At one point, marchers threw objects at Japanese stores, destroying Japanese signs and trying to demolish advertisements for Japanese products, narrowly escaping clashes with the police.Anti-riot police with shields and batons were guarding two big Japanese department stores, each two or three meters away from the other to stop protesters from swarming into the stores, whose names were covered for fear of inciting Chinese anger.Still, the heavy police force failed to prevent windows at a Japanese noodle house from being smashed, witnesses said.In Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, more than a dozen protesters were chased away by police when they were trying to set up anti-Japanese placards. Police also put up barricades around the city gymnasium and checked people's identity documents to discourage them from gathering.The police actions apparently did not stop some 10,000 people from marching in the streets shouting anti-Japanese slogans.In Zhuhai and Dongguan, two other Guangdong cities, protesters, totalling about 1,500 in each city, were seen shouting slogans such as ""Boycott Japanese products."" In Dongguan, a Japanese-invested factory was surrounded by over 1,000 protesters, who damaged the factory's doors and windows.Similar anti-Japanese protests were also reported Sunday in Nanning, Guangxi Province, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, and Shanghai.In Hong Kong, Japan's Consul General Takanori Kitamura said he is not worried about local protesters as he believes Hong Kong is a multi-cultural society where reason prevails.Kitamura said he believes the Hong Kong protest will take place peacefully and incidents of attacking Japanese consular offices will not happen in Hong Kong, as they had in China.Organizers said between 5,000 and 8,000 people will march in Hong Kong streets in protest against Japan later Sunday.

498,4/19/05,Villager (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Guangdong Sheng,23976130,SCMP: Guangzhou Authorities Step Up Efforts To Evict Villagers,"Municipal authorities in Guangzhou yesterday stepped up action to evict 250 villagers camped on the site of a university town on Xiaoguwei Island.The villagers are protesting against the flattening of their homes to make way for the project. More than 100 policemen and three to four times as many officers from the urban management bureau surrounded the makeshift settlement while earthmoving machines tore down tents, and uprooted trees and bamboo groves.An elderly woman and another woman who had been left disabled after a scuffle with police last August were forcibly carried away in an ambulance before wreckers moved in and toppled their shack.Meanwhile, two elderly villagers engaged in minor scuffles with the demolition squad. The rest of the villagers looked on as their homes were destroyed for the fifth time since December 2003.Saying their eviction was illegal, the Guolang villagers have refused to move out. The municipal government claimed it had State Council approval for the massive university project but has declined to show evidence, even in court.The initial eviction measures between April 2003 and December 2003 went largely unnoticed, despite the deployment of thousands of police, dogs and helicopters.About 10,000 villagers were driven from their farms in an exercise that mobilised a record police force of more than 30,000, said Gao Zhisheng, a Beijing lawyer who champions displaced villagers' rights.The project involved the relocation of 200,000 people altogether, he said.The villagers feel their cause deserves the same attention as the controversial forced evictions from Hanyuan for the Pubugou hydropower project.""It is the biggest such relocation in the country in terms of the people evicted and the police force used as well as the scale of the land requisition,"" Mr Gao said.""They are fighting for their rights on principles and moral grounds and their burden has grown heavier while there is no end in sight ... it's very bitter for them.""The Guangdong government has designated 4.6 billion yuan to acquire the land and compensate the villagers. But it has not explained how the funds have been used.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post (Internet Version-WWW) in English -- Internet version of Hong Kong's most prominent non-PRC-owned English-language daily newspaper.

It has been used as a supplement for centuries to enhance stamina and cure various ailments. The key Tibetan medicine commands high prices throughout East Asia.Local Tibetans accused the Chinese authorities of pocketing most of the money raised by taxing the lucrative trade.The recent unrest reportedly started when a number of Tibetans travelled to Yushu to collect yartsa gunbu and paid the local tax but were then barred from gathering the fungus and demanded their money back.Officials refused and instead summoned security forces, who then beat members of the crowd, striking some with electric prods, RFA reported.mp/fz",Hong Kong AFP in English,Qinghai,Yushu Prefecture Zado county,4,1000,"The clash was sparked by county officials levying a ""tax"" of 1,500 yuan (180 US dollars) per person on people from neighboring areas who travel there to collect a valuable and rare medicinal fungus, RFA said.The official contacted by AFP acknowledged the tax was levied but refused to comment further.http://www.boxun.com/news/gb/china/2005/06/200506072259.shtml"

Police ultimately brought out dogs to end the protest and four petitioners were bitten, the newspaper said.Two days later, on Saturday, a crowd of about 10,000, angered by the dog attack, converged on the Huangshi city government and party offices, smashing windows and property, Wen Wei Po said.A Huangshi hotel employee who gave only her surname, Li, also said that about 10,000 people participated.The crowd wrecked more than 10 vehicles, the newspaper said.The city government in Huangshi, some 600 km (370 miles) west of Shanghai, appealed for calm on Tuesday.""The city party committee and government call on the entire city to make clear the distinction between right and wrong, keep calm, and not be poisoned and bewitched by a small number of people with ulterior motives,"" it said on a government Web site.Hotel employee Li corroborated the Wen Wei Po's report on the reason for the protest. Several other residents said the case was too sensitive to comment upon.Li said there were rumours that people had been paid to take part. ""These people were really fierce. I think there must be someone or some group behind it, otherwise the common people would not care about such government affairs,"" she said.But postings on the online bulletin board denied the demonstrators had been hired.Calls to the Huangshi government office authorised to comment on the violence went unanswered. Other officials declined comment.Land disputes, corruption, abuse of power and a widening rich-poor gap have led to a rise in the number of protests in recent years. A Hong Kong newspaper quoted the Minister of Public Security as saying there were more than 74,000 last year alone.The protesters blocked the highway between Huangshi and Wuhan, and stopped traffic on a bridge, the city government said on its Web site, quoting the Huangshi Daily.The government urged the people not to spread rumours about the incident and called for stability.

He did not provide any more details.Telephones either rang busy or were not answered on Sunday at the factory and at Meishan police and government offices.

An old worker surnamed Ding said in great agitation that his family, he himself, his spouse, his son, and son-in-law all worked for the company.?

Some at the assembly said angrily that when they started out in Shenzhen they were wearing army uniforms; they ate rotten vegetables, lived in sheds, and all the possessions they had were a few rusty steel pipes to support the sheds with and a few broken wooden cases.?

580,12/23/05,Citizen (China),City Mayor (China),Demonstrate or rally,Tianjin Shi,24090467,AFP: Chinese Catholic Priests Insist on Property Return in Tianjin Ahead of Christmas,"BEIJING, Dec 23 (AFP) -- Catholic priests and nuns who lobbied for the return of property seized by Chinese authorities are insisting their demands be met, an official said Thursday, despite reports of attacks against them.An official at the Shanxi provincial religious bureau in northern China said some of the priests who travelled to the northern municipality of Tianjin to lobby for the return of church property stayed there ahead of Christmas.""Some of them have returned but some are still there,"" the official, who gave his name as Ning, told AFP.The Catholic Asia News agency said a group of 48 priests and two nuns went to Tianjin from Shanxi to ask for the return of several western-style buildings which were owned by their diocese before being confiscated by the Communist regime after 1949.Despite a promise to return the properties more than 10 years ago, the government has not handed back the properties, according to the agency.Last Friday, a group of priests and nuns were beaten by 30 people with steel bars, clubs and bricks after they demonstrated in front of Tianjin's city hall, according to the agency.One priest was knocked unconscious, a nun was hospitalised with head injuries, and four other priests were in a bad condition, it said.A spokesman for the government-backed Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association said the priests had returned to Shanxi and mediation between the church and property developers were underway.""First, the church's legitimate rights have to be protected. Second, the problem has to be solved legally through dialogue in order to safeguard social stability,"" Liu Bainian told AFP.But an official at the Tianjin religous affairs administration said the issues had not been resolved and relevant authorities between Tianjin and Shanxi were still discussing how to handle the dispute.Tianjin government officials declined to comment, saying the government had no knowledge of the dispute.The case was reminiscent of a reported conflict in the western city of Xian last month when 16 nuns were apparently beaten while attempting to prevent the demolition of a Catholic school that city authorities had sold to a developer.

But we are not sure about the number of people involved,"" a duty officer surnamed Chen told AFP. He declined to comment on whether police had broken up the demonstrations.Various accounts from villagers put the number of protestors between 1,000 and 3,000 at the peak of the demonstrations earlier this week.A villager, who declined to be named, said the numbers quickly dwindled after police armed with batons started beating people.""Now people are too scared to go,"" another villager told AFP. ""There are so many police about. They are armed with batons."" She said on Friday night there had still been more than 100 people protesting.Villagers had started a sit-in protest outside the Sanjiao township government office over inadequate compensation for farmland forcibly taken from them. When their pleas went unanswered, they started blocking a motorway.""That used to be our land, so it was reasonable for villagers to re-occupy their own land,"" said another villager, who also declined to be named.""People are so angry,"" he said. ""People have hardly enough to live on and the local officials have millions (of yuan) in their own accounts.""Villagers said the local government had started selling their farmland to companies more than 10 years ago but had given each villager just 400 to 700 yuan (49 to 86 dollars) per year in compensation.They said they had put up with it for years but that the money was not enough to live on with the rapid price rises in China in recent years.""How can we live on that in this day and age?"" she said. ""We are unskilled farmers, we can't find proper jobs.""One of the residents said his family used to own three 'mu' of farmland (0.2 hectares), on which they grew sugar cane and vegetables. But the government had sold their land for 100,000 to 200,000 yuan per mu.""As a citizen in this society, we have a duty to obey the government, but things are just getting ridiculous,"" he said. ""What choice do we have now?""An elderly villager surnamed Chen told AFP that police had set up road blocks around the village and were barring outsiders from entering.A staff member at the village government told AFP the incident was over.""It was just a small argument,"" he said. ""It has already been dealt with.""As China's economy continues to race ahead, violent clashes over land requisition have become increasingly common as a result of local officials' frequent collusion with property developers.Farmers who have had their lands confiscated for little or no compensation often have little recourse and their frustrations boil over into violent clashes with the authorities.In the past few months alone, Guangdong province has seen several major cases of unrest.As many as 30 protesters were shot dead by police in a confrontation in Dongzhou village last month, according to villagers.The confrontation stemmed from the local Shanwei city government's refusal to pay villagers adequate compensation for taking their land to build a coal-fired power plant, which will also threaten their income from fishing.In another incident widely regarded as a test case for village democracy, residents of Taishi village, Panyu city, clashed with authorities as they tried to unseat the local village chief whom they accused of illegally selling village land for private gain.The dispute turned violent last summer when police roughed up and detained scores of villagers and activists.

The protesters were put in buses and taken away. The showdown came after the Shenzhen government closed more than 100 discos and nightclubs in the Shazuicun red-light district on Wednesday. The authorities said these premises were operating without proper licences.

Two workers approached by the South China Morning Post confirmed the clash, reported on the Boxun website, had occurred.?The incident in Shiling township, Longquanyi district, is the latest in a spate of conflicts between civilians and military police that have taken place against a backdrop of growing social unrest. It also highlights the plight of workers when state-owned enterprises go bankrupt and are privatised. The Boxun report said 1,300 military police entered Shiling and tried to save the factory boss, who was taken hostage by disgruntled employees on Wednesday night. It said the boss was planning to sell the 300 million yuan factory at a discounted 80 million yuan. Government compensation of 200 million yuan for workers to be laid off had also been held up. Sources said the workers were holding the factory boss as a bargaining chip in their negotiations to buy up the facilities and continue operations. The clashes started when thousands of workers prevented military police from rescuing the boss. Over the course of two hours, police surrounded the factory, turned off street lights, blockaded crossroads, and attacked workers and passersby with electric batons. The report said at least one person was left in a critical condition and many other workers were injured. The exact number of victims could not be confirmed. The fate of the boss was not mentioned in the report. Shiling township police yesterday directed inquiries to Chengdu police, saying they had not heard about the incident. The Chengdu police propaganda office could not be reached for comment. The No354 Factory has been operating for about 40 years, employing about 3,000 workers, and providing support such as education and medical benefits to their 8,000 family members. It has been undergoing liquidation since September. Workers wanted to use their government compensation, which was still under negotiation, to buy the factory, one worker said. Last month, a substantial number of workers agreed to pool their payouts to fund the buyback. However, the boss disagreed. Many arms factories have faced a similar fate since former president Jiang Zemin ordered the military in 1998 to surrender its sprawling commercial empire and sever its business ties as part of a crackdown on corruption. Protests from workers over inadequate compensation and back pay following the privatisation of state firms have been rife on the mainland.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post (Internet Version-WWW) in English -- Internet version of Hong Kong's most prominent non-PRC-owned English-language daily newspaper.

Officials haven't confirmed the existence of a crackdown, or given details of individual cases.Many of the protesters are fasting for a day or two at a time -- some publicizing it on the Internet.""It's like the first domino falling,"" said Zhang Jiankang, a lawyer in the northwestern city of Xi'an, who started a one-day fast Monday.""I hope it can bring more conscience to the people in the Communist party, and more freedom and more democracy to China,"" Zhang said.But authorities are paying attention, Zhang and others in the movement said.""Around 11 p.m. last night (Sunday night), three policemen visited my home,"" Zhang said. ""They suggested that I not go on hunger strike, and said they hoped I can tell them of my whereabouts in the future.""Phone calls Monday to the press office of the Beijing police headquarters weren't answered.Gao said Sunday that about 70 people in 18 of mainland China's 32 provinces and regions have phoned or e-mailed him and volunteered to join some 900 people already taking part in the protest.""Thousands more have offered to join through postings on a number of Internet Web sites,"" Gao said.Zhang said he's received a lot of encouragement -- mostly from lawyers and college students in his province, Shaanxi -- after announcing his plan to join the movement.""They send me text messages through cell phones and call me to show their support,"" he said.Such a show of boldness could not only trigger a move by China's ever-efficient authorities to silence a noisy problem -- it could spark dangerous anger in a system that's institutionally conscious of saving face.But Gao said the momentum has become so disturbingly strong that he's now urging eager volunteers who are contacting him to back off.""We don't want any more innocent people to get involved,"" he said.Gao, Zhang and a core group of five others have gone so far as to publicize their names.Gao has defended dissidents and practitioners of the banned Falun Gong spiritual group in court. He is known for sending open letters to Chinese leaders criticizing government policies.""Even if our human bodies are eliminated, our family members will continue with the hunger strike protest against state tyranny, persecution and state powers behaving like organized crime groups,"" he said.Chinese activists often complain of being beaten by plainclothes police, or thugs hired by officials.Gao said the hunger strikers would stop if authorities release dissidents sent to labor camps, a practice he said ""violates China's constitution and human civilization.""However, he said that even if dissidents were released, he and other protesters would start again after six months or a year to protest what he called general police aggression against anyone who shows a hint of public defiance, or even disagreement.""The police are becoming more like hoodlums,"" he said, calling them an expression ""of tyranny -- of power with the character of organized crime.""",AP,Beijing,,14,100,hunger strike: freeing political prisoners

They appeared to be protesting over the illegal seizure of their land.""Then he started to wail and sort of kowtow and as soon as he started making noise, the police jumped on the couple,"" Taylor said.Other foreign reporters at the scene said the couple were then taken away by police.Minutes earlier, an elderly woman was arrested when she tried to hand out leaflets about her grievance to reporters who were leaving the hall after the press conference, said another foreign journalist who witnessed the event.""They pushed her on the floor and beat her,"" said the journalist, who declined to be identified. The woman was then taken away.The leaflets supported late communist chairman Mao Zedong, under whose reign Chinese were at least equally poor, but criticized later leaders Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, who allowed economic reforms to create a serious wealth gap.About half a dozen foreign journalists, including Taylor, two Spanish reporters and two South China Morning Post correspondents, who filmed the incidents or tried to talk to the petitioners were detained by police for an hour.At the press conference, Wen professed a deep concern for ordinary Chinese citizens who had been marginalized during China's economic reforms, while saying people were free to express themselves.""Every citizen in this country has the freedom of speech,"" Wen said, although he cautioned they still needed to follow the law and work within the ""national interests"".Hundreds of people who came to Beijing to air their grievances over government injustices were detained during the during the 10-day parliamentary session, activists and rights groups have said.

In one incident in southern China up to 30 protestors were killed, according to villagers who were at the scene.The number of ""public order disturbances"" in China rose by 6.6 percent to 87,000 last year, while ""mass gatherings that disturbed social order"" climbed 13 percent, according to government statistics.Although Wen offered encouragement to farmers on Tuesday, he gave no specifics about how their rights would be protected and avoided a question on whether it was right for authorities to use violence to suppress dissent.In Xiditou township, which is about 120 kilometers (75 miles) southeast of Beijing, the protest scene remained tense with police guarding the gate of the local goverment and closely monitoring movements of protestors.A handful of police vehicles were parked along the main road of Xiditou and villagers were afraid to be seen talking to a reporter.

""We want our apartments. Tell us why you have delayed the project,"" the demonstrators shouted outside the Beijing Uni-Construction Group office. Li Gang , 29, a spokesman for the protesters, said they represented more than 3,000 property owners from the group's Cuicheng Xiaoqu Estate in Chaoyang district. They have yet to receive keys to their apartments even though they paid for the homes in full in 2002 and 2003. The owners were supposed to move into their apartments three years after they paid the money. ""We suspect our money has been embezzled because some construction workers at Cuicheng told us the group owed millions of yuan in wages to the workers,"" Mr Li said. He said the owners had paid more than 3,000 yuan per square metre for their apartments, but none had been completed on schedule and construction had not started on some buildings due to be completed in June. ""We have complained to the Beijing municipal government, the municipal construction committee and other government bodies, but none of them dare handle our case. That's why we have come here,"" Mr Li said. Protests over soured property deals have become a widespread phenomenon in urban areas on the mainland because of a lack of a transparency among developers and limited avenues of recourse for property owners. Protester Chen Jing , 48, said she paid 350,000 yuan for a 108 square metre apartment in 2003. ""The contract said I would get my apartment in June this year. But as of yesterday, there was nothing at the site. I am so worried,"" she said. She had to sell her old apartment to pay for the new one and had spent more than 30,000 yuan renting accommodation for her family while they waited to move into their new home. The demonstration continued for more than an hour yesterday before a group construction manager agreed to meet the protesters. He insisted the company would stick to the construction timetable and all owners would receive the deeds to their properties in 2008.

They did not resist and were well treated by the police, according to one villager.Seven villagers have now been detained for organising the violent protest on Wednesday, in which thousands of villagers clashed with armed police.The villagers pelted the police with stones and Molotov cocktails, and the police returned fire with tear gas. At least six people were injured.Three local officials, including a deputy district director, were abducted by villagers during the chaos on Wednesday and are now being held as hostages near another sluice gate which the authorities have threatened to blow up.The situation was quiet but tense in Bomei village yesterday. Police did not proceed with attempts to destroy the second sluice gate, apparently worried about the hostages' safety.They haven't made any mass arrests and have been polite to those they have taken away, a villager said.On Wednesday, about 5,000 residents of Bomei village, in Shantou's Xilu township, tried to stop police officers who went to demolish two sluice gates the villagers built last year.

Police refused to comment.The Beijing News reported that the construction of the plant only began on Wednesday.More than 3,000 residents, many of them retirees from the prestigious China Academy of Sciences, signed a petition last year to protest the construction plan, protestors said.But so far city officials have not responded to their demands, they said.""We have asked for public hearings, we have written to the president and prime minister, but the government has not responded,"" Sun said.The power substation is one of four being built for the Olympic Games.

629,5/2/06,Villager (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,NA,23415804,SCMP: Victory for Villagers in Battle Over 'Rigged Poll' for Chief,"Complaints about a rigged election for a village head have prompted authorities in the Tianjin county of Ninghe to scrap the results and hold another poll in the next three months. More than 200 villagers from Zhaowenmin protested outside the Ninghe county government office on Saturday, alleging Friday's election was marred by intimidation, false ballot papers and attempts to buy votes. County authorities appointed officials to investigate the matter and, after finding fraudulent voting slips, ordered on Sunday that a new election be held. Their decision was seen by some as support for the villagers' demands for ""a clean election"" and ""returning farmland"", but some village representatives were concerned the new election would also be rigged. Farmers' representative Huo Changsong, 34, said even though more than 600 local residents had not voted in the election, the village committee had found a regulatory loophole to ratify the poll results. ""In order to achieve enough ballots, our current village party head, Feng Hesong, mobilised 200 locals to force villagers to hand over their ballot papers,"" he said. Mr Huo said the 600 villagers who abstained from voting did so because they had heard that at least a quarter of the ballot papers had been ""entrusted"" to others. Other residents said the party chief's agents duped, threatened and bribed them to vote for the preferred candidate. Fu Heming, 54, said one Mr Feng's men offered her 800 yuan for her family's four ballot papers. ""First of all, a gangster told me to vote for Huo Lisong , who is Feng's man. Then he offered me 800 yuan after I refused to promise him anything,"" she said. When Ms Fu rejected the money, she was threatened by Huo Lisong's 70-something mother, Shang Chunjiang . ""She threatened to destroy my two electric welding stalls if I did not to vote for her son. That's why I did not vote,"" she said. Wang Shuyun, 50, said she refused to vote because she found so many ballots had been handed over to proxies. ""They are so ignorant. You could find signatures in exactly the same handwriting among the ballot papers,"" Ms Wang said. ""Why would I vote in such a dishonest poll?"" Liu Tairong, a 60-year-old party member, said she also refused to vote because the rights to 125 hectares of farmland were sold to industrial enterprises during Mr Feng's two terms in office, but the community had not benefited from the transaction. ""None of the villagers has ever been given one fen from it,"" she said. ""We knew something was wrong when we found about 40,000 cubic metres of soil had been dug out and sold to an industrial site in January."" Zhang Zhichao, another of the farmers' representatives, said construction workers told them 2.5 yuan was paid for each cubic metre of soil. ""It's a waste,"" Mr Zhang said. ""The soil is very rich and suitable for farming because it used to be a fish farm. The clay has more than 17 years' of fish manure in it."" Mr Feng is under investigation for embezzling community funds so could not stand for re-election. The protesters said they were backing 61-year-old Huo Shenglin in the next poll, in the hope that he would fight for their land and soil. But they were also concerned that Mr Feng could still influence the result because he was still the village's party chief. The situation is similar to that in Guangdong's Taishi village, where residents were repeatedly thwarted in their attempts to dismiss their village head. Outspoken human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng was not optimistic about the prospects for the Zhaowenmin villagers' struggle for democracy. ""They technically just won the first round, but it was an exceptional case. ""Villagers in Zhaowenmin are lucky because their county authority is willing to handle their complaint. But I don't think it is a common phenomena on the mainland,"" Mr Gao said. He said villagers would succeed in enforcing their rights only when the central government decided to improve the political system.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post (Internet Version-WWW) in English -- Internet version of Hong Kong's most prominent non-PRC-owned English-language daily newspaper.

Each also held a copy of China's constitution.The eleven included rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng and dissidents Li Hai, Liu Jingsheng and Ma Wendu.""We are exercising our civil rights through non-violent means,"" Zhao told AFP by phone, with he and another activist saying there were around 200 supporters in total at the courthouse in Yinan county.Zhao later briefly called back to say he and the 10 other activists from Beijing had been taken away in police vehicles.Beijing-based activist Hu Jia, who has been under house arrest since Tuesday to bar him from traveling to support Chen, said the activists were released a few hours later after being interrogated.Zhao suffered from a broken nose and Gao's arm was sprained during the morning's unrest, Hu said, adding that the plain-clothes police had taken their money, cameras and a laptop computer.Zhao was not reachable on the phone on Thursday afternoon. Local police declined to comment.Chen's lawyer Li Jinsong said the judge at Yinan county court told him the trial was postponed because prosecution authorities needed to gather more evidence. The trial had already been postponed from Monday.An officer at the court confirmed the postponement to AFP, saying more investigation was needed, but declined to give a new date.Chen, 34, known as a ""barefoot lawyer"" because he is self-educated, ran into trouble last year after exposing local authorities' abuse of the nation's population law which aims to ensure parents only have one child.He accused authorities in Linyi city, Yinan county, of forcing women to be sterilized and have abortions as late as eight months into their pregnancy, measures outlawed by the central government.Chen was placed under house arrest in September last year.He was officially arrested in March after about 400 people from his home village of Dongshigu protested against the treatment of him and his family, leading to clashes with police in which several people were slightly injured.Chen was charged last month with ""willfully harming public property"" and ""gathering masses to disturb traffic order.""Although the charges are not directly related to his expose of the Linyi city officials' one-child actions, international human rights groups and Chinese activists have said the legal maneuvers are aimed at silencing him.More than 100 Chinese intellectuals and dissidents signed an open letter to the government last month urging Chen's release.Rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also protested Chen's detention and raised concerns over reports that he had been beaten in jail.""When Chen tried to make proper use of Chinas legal system, the response wasnt due process,"" Sophie Richardson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, said in a statement.""It was house arrest, physical abuse and then disappearance by local authorities.

All morning cases had to be postponed. The authorities mobilised hundreds of police to keep the crowd under control. Judges and court staff had to be escorted into the building by police. The crowd dispersed peacefully at about noon after their representatives reached an agreement with the authorities. Nobody was injured or arrested.Shangsha Investment rented a building to local furniture maker Oriental Fortune in 1996, but it has not paid any rent since 1999 and refuses to move out.The company sued the furniture maker two years ago and won the case. But local authorities failed to carry out the judge's order, saying they could not contact the person in charge of Oriental Fortune.Shangsha Investment tried to take back the building by force in March. But the furniture company again refused to leave and hired alleged triad members to guard the site. The two sides began fighting and had to be separated by police. ""The police only arrested some of our people but did not touch the other side. It's obvious they have got some powerful connections,"" one shareholder said.The shareholders said yesterday Oriental Fortune owed them nearly 12 million yuan in unpaid rent. They demanded that the company hand back their property in compliance with the court order.The Shenzhen court agreed to look into the case yesterday. Oriental Fortune's general manager could not be reached for comment. Shangsha Investment was set up by residents of Shangshacun, one of the original villages in Shenzhen. The residents, mostly farmers, rezoned their farmland for commercial use after Shenzhen was made a special economic zone 25 years ago. All villagers became shareholders. Shenzhen's justice system has long been criticised. Many court orders cannot be carried out because of corruption, a lack of efficiency or intervention from the government.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post (Internet Version-WWW) in English -- Internet version of Hong Kong's most prominent non-PRC-owned English-language daily newspaper.

They said the warehouse was built on land that had been seized by the local government and sold to the developer.The villagers initially refused to let the officials and dozens of guests from Thailand, Germany, Britain and Hong Kong leave. They demanded the officials investigate the deal and punish corrupt village chiefs, according to one villager. Later they let the guests leave but still held a few local government officials hostage.About 1,000 riot police arrived at 10am yesterday and tried to disperse the crowd with tear gas, the villager said. They eventually managed to escort the officials out of the building.But protesters refused to leave and continued to clash with the police. It was not clear last night if any arrests had been made. ""There are about 4,000 to 5,000 people this morning. We have been protesting against corruption for many months and we are very determined,"" the villager said.Yesterday's episode was one of the many incidents of rural unrest in the area recently. Shunde, an industrialised district under the administration of Foshan, has been plagued with corruption scandals and social unrest for months. It was originally a rural town but incorporated into Foshan a few years ago and underwent rapid industrialisation.Most of its farmland has been industrialised or converted for commercial use. But villagers say they have gained little from the development, with local officials teaming up with businessmen to illegally seize their land.Protests against alleged corruption had been reported in villages like Sanzhou, Xiashi, Xinmin and Xiyong in recent weeks.Tensions escalated after last year's village election - the only form of direct election allowed on the mainland - a village representative said. Many village chiefs appointed by local officials lost their seats to independent candidates sworn to weed out corruption. But the old guard refused to relinquish their power and clashed with the newly elected village officials.The standoff had erupted into violent clashes in recent weeks, a villager said. Scores of scuffles had broken out since last month.""They hired thugs and brought their people to the village office.

664,11/11/06,Protester (China),Police (China),Demonstrate or rally,Beijing Shi,7333196,Police and demonstrators square off in Beijing over crackdown on dogs   ,"BEIJING (AP) - Demonstrators angry over a crackdown on dogs staged a noisy protest in China's capital Saturday, decrying police killings of dogs and new limits on pet ownership.About 200 police strung up tape to cordon off the roughly 500 demonstrators -- many wearing buttons that said ""Stop the indiscriminate killing"" -- as they held up stuffed animals, waved signs and chanted near the entrance to the Beijing Zoo.Police detained at least 18 demonstrators in nearby vans for several hours before releasing them, protesters said. Police declined comment.Touching off the demonstration was new restrictions that limit households to one dog and ban larger breeds. Police in recent days have gone through city neighborhoods, seizing unregistered dogs and beating some of them to death, witnesses said.""All of us who have dogs to walk are feeling very anxious,"" said Wu Jiang, a protester and pet shop owner who keeps a yellow Labrador retriever. ""Most of us only dare come out at night and even then we have to be really careful.""Keeping pets has evoked controversy in China for decades. Banned as a middle-class habit in the radical Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and '70s, dog-raising surged anew afterward with the introduction of free-market reforms.Complaints about vicious dogs, barking and excrement-covered sidewalks prompted Beijing to impose height limits in 1995, banning dogs taller than 35 centimeters (14 inches) from the city center. Many cities have enacted similar measures.A sharp rise in rabies cases this year led to a renewed clampdown across China. State-run newspapers reported Saturday that 326 people died from rabies in October, again making it the leading cause of death among infectious diseases.To enforce the crackdown, police in many parts of the country have beaten stray or unregistered dogs to death, sometimes in front of their owners.Beijing responded by raising fines for having unregistered and unvaccinated dogs, adopting the new one-dog-per-family rule and extending the ban on larger dogs from the city center to encompass the surrounding suburbs.""We're asking city residents to go along with us and if they discover any unregistered or stray dogs to report to us by phone,"" the Beijing News quoted the city's vice director of agriculture, Ren Zonggang, as saying in comments on the government's Web site.In some cases, protesters said, dog-owners have been given as little as one week's notice to get rid of their large dogs or move to outlying districts. Protesters said the measures are not only inhumane but incorrectly place the burden of punishment on the dogs, not the owners.""The main point here should be the way dog owners raise their dogs,"" said Jeff He of the International Fund for Animal Welfare in Beijing, who watched the protest from beyond the cordon of yellow and black police tape.Organizers of the protest said they had applied for a permit but had been refused. Though the demonstration was largely peaceful, anti-riot squads in helmets and dark uniforms were dispatched, plainclothes police milled through the crowds and large numbers of uniformed police sat in trucks down the street.Police tried to prevent reporters from taking pictures and warned protesters that they could suffer serious consequences for their actions.""It was like martial law out there,"" said Wu Jiang, the pet shop owner. ""We said to them 'We're taxpayers. Why are you treating us this way?'""Police used loudspeakers on a nearby van to urge protesters to take their complaints to a special desk set up inside the zoo.

Six people have been arrested, and police were still hunting down protest leaders.""Many people have gone into hiding and daren't go out because of that,"" she said.The resident said villagers were very upset because they had been barred from visiting their injured relatives in hospitals.Another local resident, a woman farmer surnamed Zhang, also confirmed the incident.""The police descended on the protest with lots of dogs,"" he said in a telephone interview.""After we lost our land, we have also lost our livelihood, we have nothing to farm on anymore,"" she said.Police at Zhangzhuang village refused to comment Wednesday.As China's economy continues to race ahead, violent clashes over land requisitions have become increasingly common as a result of local officials' frequent collusion with property developers.Chinese authorities are sensitive to signs of social unrest and often mobilize large numbers of police to break up protests.Police on Monday surrounded a hospital in a southwestern city after 2,000 people protested over the death of a child who was allegedly refused medical treatment.

One brother died, it said.Protests have risen sharply across China in recent years as ordinary Chinese vent anger over official corruption, a growing rich-poor gap and land confiscations. Earlier this month, a protest in another Hunan village turned bloody after 20,000 area residents clashed with police over rising bus fares. Reports said at least one person was killed.When contacted, villagers in Ganyi said they were unclear about the incident or hung up immediately, a common response in China where residents refuse to talk about sensitive issues for fear of retaliation from authorities.An official from the provincial Communist Party office, who gave only his surname Ke, confirmed there had been a dispute in Ganyi but said he had no details. Calls to the police station at Yongzhou, the city that oversees Ganyi, rang unanswered.The Post said Ganyi was cordoned off after hundreds of policemen stormed the area and detained villagers.An unidentified villager told the daily that the party chief had been selling trees and land to lumber companies.""Our village has a tradition that each villager can climb the hill and cut down two trees for his coffin,"" he was quoted as saying. ""But since last year, we have been stopped ... and told that both the trees and land now belong to lumber companies.""He said an offer by the Ganyi government to pay five trees to each villager was ""unbelievably low"" and would not be accepted.The Ganyi confrontation comes days after China's legislature passed a property law which offers the same protections for private and public property.

Property with value they confiscated, things with no value they destroyed.""The work teams confiscated everything from livestock, to electronic goods and household items such as pots and pans and teapots, according to the woman and other accounts by locals posted on the Internet.Photos on the Internet showed family planning work teams dressed in military fatigues and helmets carrying sledge hammers as they marched through Guangxi villages.On Friday, similar demonstrations erupted in neighbouring Shuiming township, with locals confronting up to 1,000 police armed with clubs and dogs, one witness said.""It's hard to say how many people were there, (but) you could say there was a sea of people,"" a man in Shuiming township told AFP also on condition of anonymity out of fear of government retribution.Hong Kong press reports said up to 50,000 farmers protested against the family planning policies in the four Guangxi townships in recent days.

2408,6/7/07,Student (China),Police (China),"Protest violently, riot",Beijing Shi,11771484,UPDATE 2-Hundreds of students riot in central China   ,"(Adds details and background, paragraphs 5, 6 and 12)BEIJING, June 7 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Chinese students clashed with police and overturned and burnt their car after street inspectors beat up a female student, a police officer and witnesses said on Thursday, the latest in a series of public disturbances.Students from several universities in Zhengzhou, in the central province of Henan, went on the rampage on Wednesday after a student vendor was beaten by several inspectors as they cleared her unlicensed stall, a student witness told Reuters.Last June, thousands of students from the same city smashed windows and ransacked their campus in a riot sparked by anger over the wording of their diplomas.""I was also selling things on the street, and I could not take it any more, when I saw them even beating up a girl, so I joined the riot by throwing a brick at the inspectors,"" a student from the Henan University of Finance and Economics said.""I saw more than 10 people running after an inspector and trying to beat him, and some other people overturned a car and set fire to it,"" other student witness said by telephone.About 100 police, some armed with electric rods and shields, arrived on the scene, sealing the street and taking people away, the student said.The Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy put the number of students rioting at 1,000. One witness put it at 2,000.A police officer also confirmed the riot.""A lot of students were rioting last night, and the situation was quite serious,"" the official, surnamed Wang, told Reuters.

While the State Environmental Protection Administration's (Sepa) appeal for a postponement of the incinerator in the Haidian district was applauded by residents, it has been brushed off by local authorities.The 750-million-yuan incinerator project was planned by Haidian district to ease mounting complaints by people from at least two villages and eight residential areas over the unbearable stench from a landfill. Approved by the city's environmental bureau in 2005, construction was scheduled to start in March and the plant put into operation before the Olympic Games next August. But it has been delayed due to strong opposition from local residents, green groups and mainland media, including state television. More than 1,000 residents took to the streets on World Environment Day on Tuesday to demonstrate in front of Sepa's headquarters in Xicheng district. In a statement posted on Sepa's website, deputy director Pan Yue accused city authorities of violating a central government edict that banned waste-treatment projects near residential quarters.""Given the sensitive location of the Liulitun waste-incineration and power plant, the city's environmental bureau should allow experts to hold more debates and give the public a bigger say,"" he said.Mr Pan quoted a document by the city's green watchdog in 1995 that had even voiced concerns over the grave environmental impact of the landfill - that was eventually built in 1999 - on local communities and the city's main freshwater channel, which was about 1km away. Sepa urged the city government to halt the incinerator pending further debate and said it would announce its final decision on the project soon.But local authorities have insisted the project will have no impact on people's health and should go ahead, saying the landfill, the only one in Haidian, cannot handle the 2,500 tonnes of domestic waste produced in the district every day.City and district officials said they had yet to formally receive Sepa's decision, even though Mr Pan's statement was carried prominently by mainland internet news portals. ""We have not got Sepa's letter informing us of its decision and we understand it is not Sepa's final decision,"" said Du Shaozhong , a deputy director of Beijing's environmental bureau.Residents in Dongbutou and Tundian villages and Yihe Villas, while are within 1km of the landfill, say they have suffered from foul air for years and dare not open their windows. But their previous complaints to the government had been ignored. ""It is good to hear Sepa's decision, but will it really be able to stop local authorities building the incineration plant?"" asked a resident surnamed Wang from Yihe Villas.Environmental sources said Sepa had overestimated its clout.""The statement was prompted by the Tuesday protest and designed to appease the people affected and maintain social stability,"" one source said. ""But it received a silent protest from local authorities, and Sepa has obviously fallen foul of local authorities in the city.""[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post (Internet Version-WWW) in English -- Internet version of Hong Kong's most prominent non-PRC-owned English-language daily newspaper.

They don't even have enough food,"" Li told The Associated Press by telephone Wednesday. He refused to give his full name.For four days beginning June 1, villagers carrying banners and chanting slogans surrounded the Yantan No. 2 Hydroelectric Power Station's staff residence, and marched to the dam site to demand more compensation, the newspaper said.It said several hundred soldiers and armed police were trucked in to help contain the protests, and five villagers were injured in clashes.There were arrests, though reports did not specify how many.The paper said Yantan farmland was flooded several years ago when the dam caused the level of the local Red River to overflow its banks.Villagers were enraged when the central government allegedly gave Yantan officials $370,000 last year to help compensate residents - but only a portion of it was distributed, according to the paper.Villagers claimed that local officials pocketed some of the money.The Mingpao said that villagers had been sporadically protesting since April, but that last week's demonstrations were the largest yet.The government has been giving every villager a subsidy of $4 per month regardless of how much land they lost, it said.Li estimated that about 3,000 villagers had protested last week, though he was unaware of anyone being injured.Phones at the Yantan government office and public security bureau were unanswered Wednesday.

It said more than 40 people, including the owner of the hospital, Lin Shiqiang , were detained by police for questioning, but they were later released. The boy's family accused Mr Lin of hiring thugs to beat up the protesters. The riot in Binzhou , Hunan, was triggered by the death of Duan Jiahao , who was diagnosed with influenza by doctors at Fukang Hospital. His parents took the baby to the hospital last Sunday because he had a fever.The boy's condition deteriorated in spite of treatment. He was transferred to a state-run hospital but died shortly after arriving. Doctors at that hospital said the boy had suffered from meningitis, not common flu, the report said.The boy's father, Duan Tangxian , demanded that Fukang Hospital pay 80,000 yuan in compensation for the misdiagnosis, but the hospital has refused.The father then gathered hundreds of relatives, friends and neighbours from his hometown and staged a protest outside the hospital on Friday. They put the boy's body in the centre of the hospital lobby and hung a banner calling for justice at the main entrance. The protest attracted hundreds of onlookers, a Fukang Hospital spokesman said yesterday.The protesters said they were attacked shortly afterwards by about 100 men armed with iron bars. The hospital spokesman acknowledged the incident yesterday and admitted that the attackers were hospital security guards. He said the demonstrators had blocked traffic, and that hospital officials had called the police to intervene, but their calls went unanswered, so they had no choice but to use force to expel the protesters.""We just sent our security guards to protect the safety of our hospital because local police refused to help,"" he said. ""In fact, they (the protesters) just wanted to blackmail us by creating chaos.""The spokesman said Fukang Hospital was also a victim in the incident.He said its doctors had suggested that the family take the sick boy to a bigger hospital to have a comprehensive check-up, but the father had refused to listen. ""We are only a small private hospital, and we know we are only capable of treating simple illnesses,"" the spokesman said. He added that the dispute had been settled but did not provide any details.

They demand for better treatment. Many public security personnel came to the scene to disperse them and there were clashes between the protestors and the public security personnel. A report said that the public security personnel arrested several protestors. Answering on 20 August this newspaper's queries, Feihuang Shiya Electronic Company admitted the incident and said that the head office has dispatched personnel to negotiate with the workers.At 0730 on the morning of 20 August [Beijing time or 2330 GMT on 19 August], staff and workers from German-funded Feihuang Company, that is situated in the Hangcheng Industrial Zone, Xixiang Township, Baoan, gathered at Nantai Overpass near National Highway 107 to stage a protesting rally, demanding that the company improve their welfare and treatment. Shenzhen social order units and public security personnel promptly arrived at the scene to disperse them. Later the workers gathered at an open space near the toll gates at Sanwei Road. Subsequently, over 100 fully-armed riot policemen arrived at the scene. Together with other public security personnel, their total number was 500. They surrounded the workers. When some workers resisted, they were taken away.It Is Said a Worker's Leg Was Fractured.A report from the scene said: A worker's leg was hit and fractured, and three or four workers were arrested. The workers futilely asked the public security personnel to release their detained colleagues. Two hours later, the factory's senior officials came to the scene to negotiate with the workers, asking the workers to send representatives to hold talks at the factory. However, the workers were only willing to negotiate after their detained colleagues have been released. Both sided failed to reach any consensus. Subsequently, the public security personnel used loudspeakers to urge the workers to disperse. Otherwise, they would be dispersed by force. Later the workers successively returned to continue their strike at the factory.The Workers Attain Higher Wages But Lower Bonuses and Welfare.A striker told this newspaper: Even though the factory gave us higher wages earlier, it has reduced our bonuses and other welfare benefits. Meanwhile our workload has increased considerably. Now one person has to accomplish the normal workload of two people. The factory has covertly reduced the benefits of the staff and workers under the pretext of providing higher wages. She said: If the factory management refuses to make concessions, we will continue our strike on 21 August. At present, we are awaiting the factory management's response.Ch'iu Tzu-hui, official in charge of ""the Campaign for College Teachers and Students To Supervise Immoral Enterprises"" in Hong Kong, said: As of the evening of 20 August, four workers were still being detained and the factory management has yet to formally respond to the workers' demands. Answering on 20 August this newspaper's queries, Feihuang Shiya Electronic Company admitted the incident but denied the poor treatment to its staff and workers. It said: The strike inflicts losses for the company. At present, the head office and relevant leaders have dispatched personnel to negotiate with the workers.?

Official media do not report on ethnic clashes, the likely reason why word of the incident was only just now leaking out.Numerous violent incidents between Hui and Han have been reported in Shandong and the neighboring province of Henan in recent years, including a Dec. 12, 2000, clash in which police shot dead at least six Hui men.That incident was sparked by a sign hung from a Han market stall advertising pork that was halal, or approved for consumption by Muslims. Islamic dietary laws strictly prohibit the consumption in any form of pork, the staple meat of the mainstream Han population.China has about 10 million Hui citizens, along with a similar number of Turkish ethnic Uighur Muslims living in the country's far West.",AP,Shandong, town of Shimiao,16,20,
2426,9/15/07,Student (China),Police (China),"Protest violently, riot",Heilongjiang Sheng,22560456,HK Paper: Demobilized Soldiers-Turned-Students in Heilongjiang Clash With Police,"Following the recent disturbances involving demobilized soldiers in three railway schools on the mainland, the authorities have issued an emergency order for all demobilized soldiers in 12 railway schools nationwide to suspend their schooling and be repatriated to their native places. This measure triggered dissatisfaction among the students of the Qiqiha'er Municipal Railway School in Heilongjiang. About 1,000 students were involved in a disturbance and clashed with the public security and special police personnel arriving on the scene on the night before last (13 September), and at least 10 people were injured. In response to this paper's inquiry, a staff member at the Qiqiha'er Municipal Railway School confirmed the incident and pointed out that the authorities had dispatched a task force to handle it and that the situation had currently returned to normal. On the night before last, according to a report by the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy, demobilized soldiers at the Qiqiha'er Municipal Railway School began to do damage to the teaching building and dormitory with beer bottles and also attempted to break out of the school and head for the railway station. Subsequently, several hundred public security and special police personnel armed with loaded weapons arrived on the scene to quell the disturbance, during which the two sides clashed. One Thousand People Involved in Disturbance in Protest Against Repatriation In the small hours of yesterday morning, the rumor of two demobilized soldiers being beaten to death triggered dissatisfaction among other demobilized soldiers, and demobilized soldiers nearby also came as reinforcements. During the incident, three police vehicles were overturned and damaged, at least 10 people were injured, and the public security personnel arrested five demobilized soldiers. The incident was not quelled until 0300 yesterday morning. It has been confirmed that there was no fatality. Five People Arrested, Curfew Imposed in School According to the information center, after the demobilized soldiers' disturbances in?three railway schools in Inner Mongolia, Hubei, and Shaanxi on 3 September, the Ministry of Railways issued an emergency order for over 6,000 demobilized soldiers in the 12 [railway] schools nationwide to suspend their schooling and be repatriated to their native places. But as no mention was made of resettlement and placement, the students were dissatisfied. It was reported that the Ministry of Railways made arrangements at the beginning of this year for demobilized soldiers to receive two-year training in secondary technical schools and senior vocational schools. Most of the Qiqiha'er Railway School students involved in this disturbance are demobilized soldiers newly admitted to the school. After the disturbance, the authorities have imposed a curfew in the school. Wu Zhanqun, a demobilized soldier from Qiqiha'er, told this paper that the demobilized soldiers with rural household registrations have been significantly short changed by the authorities: They are generally only given a demobilization fee of between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan and are not provided with any assistance and training. Consequently, it is difficult for them to find employment for lack of specialized skills. Johnny Lau Yui-siu, a local current affairs commentator, maintained that it is understandable why the demobilized soldiers are dissatisfied when their livelihoods can no longer be safeguarded following their demobilization. But relative to the huge number of demobilized Chinese servicemen, the ratio of demobilized soldiers involved in disturbances is not high. ?

738,10/2/07,Protester (China),Police (China),Demonstrate or rally,Beijing Shi,11373175,China River Raft Operators On Strike After Clash With Police   ,"BEIJING (AP)--River raft operators on strike in a southern Chinese resort town tussled with police in the latest unrest involving disgruntled groups ranging from cab drivers to college students, a newspaper and local residents said Tuesday.Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper said the raft operators were in price negotiations centered around a government-run company, which has taken over management of the brisk rafting business along a stretch of the Yulong River that carries tourists past the area's famous limestone peaks.Large numbers of raft operators gathered Monday, the start of the lucrative, week-long National Day holiday outside government offices in Yangshuo, said a man who answered the town's tourist hot line.""Rafters want to raise their price, but the local government does not allow it, and there was a small conflict,"" said the man, who gave only his surname, Li.He said police and rafters shoved each other but no injuries were reported. Officers took away about a dozen people for questioning, Li said.The South China Morning Post said that police fired a shot into the crowd, which swelled to about 1,000, while trying to catch a protester. No one was hurt, it said.The government-run company had ordered the rafters to disband the 11 local enterprises they formed in 2004, the paper said.Under the government plan, rafters who earned 54.50 yuan (US$7) per trip would now make 37.5 yuan (US$5) instead, the newspaper said, citing a demonstrator named Pan Chenhua.No other details were given about the new pricing system.Telephones weren't answered at the Yangshuo County government office or the area's rafting service management center.A woman who answered the telephone at the Yangshuo police station said she couldn't comment because she wasn't authorized to talk to the press but said the ""situation was normal"" on Tuesday and there were lots of tourists in the area.Li said hundreds of rafters were on strike but would consider taking customers if they paid a higher price.The rafting route began in the 1990s and has become a booming business, the SCMP said. Yangshuo County earned 40 million yuan (US$5 million) from rafting trips during last year's National Day holiday, the paper said.Chinese authorities regularly struggle to defuse disputes over pay, regulations and working conditions amid rising inequality and cutthroat job competition despite the booming economy.Recent months have seen riots, strikes and demonstrations among demobilized soldiers, taxi drivers seeking to reduce monthly payments to their employers, and college students angered at receiving degrees considered less valuable than those promised.

742,10/9/07,Villager (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,NA,23107481,HK Daily: Hubei Villagers Injured During Protest Against Rubbish Pollution,"?The government of Yingshan County within the boundariesof Huanggang City in Hubei Province built a rubbish station in WenquanTownship, causing severe pollution to a local village. Since last month severalhundred villagers have staged a sit-down protest outside the rubbish station,preventing garbage trucks from dumping there, and calling on the government tohalt operations at the rubbish station. On the 3rd of this month authoritiescleared the scene of the protest and dumped rubbish by force using a forklift.At least five villagers were injured in the chaos. In response to an inquiryfrom this paper, a police officer from Wenquan Township's police stationacknowledged that an action to clear the scene did take place that day, butdenied that any villagers were injured, and asserted ""It was handled inaccordance with the law."" The rubbish station was constructed in 2003. It islocated on a hill more than a hundred meters high at the village of Shawanhe[Sandy Bay River] in Wenquan Township. But the rubbish station has nofacilities to prevent seepage. The piles of rubbish are not disinfected either.Thus a lot of filth and wastewater flows to the foot of the mountain, with avery adverse effect on the lives of the more than 300 villagers who live there. 400 people demonstrate, 2 arrested Beginning at the start of September this year, severaldozen villager households began a self-initiated protest demonstration at therubbish station. They also set up a barrier at an intersection to stop garbagetrucks from entering. Some of the villagers also hung a banner reading,""Garbage dump pollution, ordinary people must survive."" They set uptents and started a sit-down protest. For a time there were over 400 protestersthere. According to reports, the villagers' protest caught theattention of local officials. Yingshan County's deputy head Guo Yinghu went tothe garbage dump to find out the situation. Testing of water sources in thevillage of Shawanhe revealed amounts of E. coli bacteria and chloride which farexceed standards. The government subsequently engaged in a dialogue withrepresentatives of the villagers, but the two sides could not reach consensuson the issue of moving the rubbish station. Several villagers hit and injured by forklift Because several hundred villagers were blocking the roadinto the rubbish station, on the 3rd of this month the police station inWenquan Township, along with personnel from an environmental protectionmonitoring and inspection battalion, took action to clear the area. They drovea forklift to forcibly dump garbage, at which time the two sides clashed.Several villagers were hit and injured by the forklift, and two villagersleading the protest were taken away by Public Security personnel. An official at Yingshan County's EnvironmentalProtection Bureau, a woman surnamed Wang, told this paper that construction ofthe rubbish station was part of a government plan, and was completely""reasonable and legal."" She acknowledged that the rubbish station hasaffected the local environment. She blamed the chaotic situation in thatvillage for a temporary halt in the transport of rubbish to the rubbishstation. She said the government is handling the matter.

745,10/26/07,Villager (China),Other Authorities / Officials (China),Demonstrate or rally,Guangdong Sheng,23131744,SCMP: Alleged Killing by Police Sparks Village Protest in Guangzhou,"Several dozen angry villagers from Guangzhou 's Huadu district demonstrated outside city government offices yesterday, accusing district authorities of a cover-up over a fatal shooting of a villager last month, allegedly by a police officer. The protesters were demanding information about the death of 27-year-old Zhong Zhigen , who was shot in the head without warning on September 26 at about 1 am. Zhong's brother, Zhong Zhiwei , said about 80 villagers gathered at the offices around 10.30am, with relatives of the dead man dressed in white clothes bearing the Chinese characters for ""injustice"" and ""Huadu police shoot people"". Mr Zhong said a senior Huadu official arrived at noon and left with about 50 protesters to discuss the issue. According to Zhong's friend, Yuan Yongjiao , a police officer fired after a fight broke out early on September 26 over a car crash and about 20 people became involved in the dispute. He said police first fired a warning shot to stop the crowd fighting. ""Then I saw the officer catch Zhong, pin him down and shoot towards his head, when he was not dangerous at all,"" Mr Yuan said. Zhong was sent to hospital but died of his injuries last week, leaving behind a wife and a one-year-old son. ""Not one police officer visited us when my brother was in hospital,"" Mr Zhong said. ""They promised to give us an explanation a month ago, which were just lies, and that is why we were here to demonstrate."" Mr Zhong said that the Huadu government had asked them to wait for a court decision about the death but that the family did not trust the court system. The family wants the police officer prosecuted and 3 million yuan in compensation but they are worried the district will cover up evidence. ""I have no confidence in the law and any [court] sentence in Huadu,"" Mr Zhong said. ""And we did not hire a lawyer because it would be useless if the case involves officials."" The Huadu Public Security Bureau confirmed the case but said they could not give any details about the case without approval from higher authorities. And Dai Xinjue , the deputy district head in charge of the negotiations with the family, said yesterday that he was negotiating over the compensation and had no time to answer any questions. Mr Zhong said his sister-in-law, who was negotiating with the officials, told him that prosecutors in Huadu had agreed yesterday to charge the officer with manslaughter. But Mr Dai said he did not know anything about that deal. Pu Zhiqiang , a Beijing? lawyer, said the Huadu case was a good example of how grass-roots people had lost confidence in the mainland legal and justice systems. He said the demonstration could help Zhong's family garner public support, which could put pressure on the local government. But Mr Pu also said it was rare for Guangzhou police to use guns if it was only a normal street fight, and it was possible that some details of why the police shot Zhong had not been revealed.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post (Internet Version-WWW) in English -- Internet version of Hong Kong's most prominent non-PRC-owned English-language daily newspaper.

753,11/17/07,Professor (China),Police (China),Demonstrate or rally,Guangdong Sheng,10813697,Shot professor's family accuse Guangzhou police of cover-up   ,"About a dozen family members of a professor shot dead this week by Guangzhou police demonstrated outside provincial government offices yesterday, accusing police of trying to cover up the shooting.The protesters, including the wife and 16-year old daughter of Yin Fangming , asked provincial leaders to tightly monitor the investigation, which is mainly in the hands of police. Family and colleagues fear the officers will skew the investigation and blame the death on the professor.The protesters gathered at the offices at about 9.30am, with relatives holding placards bearing the characters for ""Clear Doctor Yin's Name"".""Do not touch me. I am not going anywhere and I do not fear anyone, even the governor,"" Yin's widow, Chen Yan , shouted at police trying to usher the protesters off the street and into an office for talks.Yin, 43, an associate professor in Zhujiang Hospital's neurosurgery department, was shot dead at about 5am on Tuesday as police questioned him about the number plates on his vehicle.Despite a provincial ban on coverage of the shooting, Yin's death has generated a storm of controversy in Guangzhou.The city's Public Security Bureau issued a brief public statement on the case on Wednesday morning, saying police were forced to shoot at the professor after he tried to evade questioning by two officers and drive off. It said Yin had grabbed an officer's staff identity card and dragged the officer with him for several metres.But Yin's family and colleagues say police are lying and they want to talk to a passenger in the car, Wang Yanming , a friend of Yin and the only witness who was not a police officer. They said police had not responded to requests to question the man.Mr Wang was taken away by police on Tuesday morning to help with the inquiry, and his brother, Wang Jun , saw him in the offices of the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau at about 2am on Wednesday.But no one, not even the lawyers hired by the hospital for Yin's family, have been able to contact him since.A hospital source said Wang Yanming was believed to have been sitting in Yin's car discussing treatment for his dying father when Yin was shot.Yin's family and colleagues said Wang Yanming was the one person who could clear Yin's name because his version of the shooting conflicted with the police statement.An emergency room doctor said one of his colleagues heard Wang Yanming giving a statement to police and admitting Yin had taken the officer's staff identity card because the police had taken some of his papers. But he did not mention Yin's car injuring or dragging the officer.Ms Chen said she and Wang Jun had repeatedly asked investigators about Wang Yanming's whereabouts and when he would be released.But the police said they had no idea and could not answer such questions without asking for instructions from higher up.""No one has told us why Mr Wang has been kept in police custody for such a long time,"" Ms Chen said.Yin's relatives said the Ministry of Public Security had sent a supervisory team to Guangzhou to monitor the investigation.Beijing-based lawyer Mo Shaoping said Wang Jun should demand police give him a reason for keeping his brother in custody for almost four days.

Investors in the tens of thousands who participated in a high-return ""ant-breeding"" investment scheme besieged the head office of ""Yilishen,"" a well-known health products enterprise, to demand payment of money owed?them that totaled several billion yuan. The protesters surrounded the Liaoning provincial government offices last night, denouncing the authorities for ineffective supervision. The authorities sent thousands of public security and armed police officers to maintain order and also imposed a stringent news blackout. Demanding Payment of Several Billion Yuan's Worth of Money Owed Yilishen, which caused the large-scale, 10,000-strong protests, signed contracts with several hundred thousand investors promising them high returns, with the investors buying ant-breeding equipment from the company for 10,000 yuan apiece and selling ants that were raised back to the company in installments. They were guaranteed high returns. Most of the investors were ordinary people and farmers. In recent months, Yilishen has suddenly stopped buying ants from the ant breeders, and it has not paid the ant breeders their dividends in installments in accordance with the repayment plan. There are rumors that the company has gone bankrupt and that its senior officials have fled. Investors in the tens of thousands yesterday descended on the head office in Shenyang from all directions, but they had no idea what to do. It is reported that the protesters broke through police cordons last night, unfurled banners, and shouted slogans as they charged at the Liaoning provincial party committee offices. The atmosphere was extremely tense as thousands of public security and armed police officers were deployed to keep order. As of late last night, the entire public security establishment in Shenyang was still reticent about the developments and was refusing to disclose any information. In the meantime, online discussions about Yilishen and information on the protests have all been deleted by the authorities.

We will announce this very soon.""The official refused to comment on reports that police and dogs attacked workers trying to leave the factory and forced them to remain on the premises.China's inflation has remained at a near-decade high over the past three months as the government has scrambled to calm fears over fast growing food and fuel prices.The consumer price index was up 6.5 percent in October over the same period last year largely led by a rise in food prices, which were up 17.6 percent during the month.According to the US-based Radio Free Asia, several hundred police converged on the factory in Dongguan city and beat workers with clubs and arrested strike leaders.""More than a thousand police arrived on the scene with dozens of dogs to repress the (workers),"" the report said, citing witnesses.""Many workers were injured by the dogs and arrested.""City officials and police in Dongguan, a booming industrial city located in Guangdong's textile factory belt, refused to comment on the strike when contacted by AFP.According to a secretary in the factory offices, several thousand workers are employed at the plant with food and lodging expenses docked from the employees monthly wages.

2431,12/20/07,Protester (China),Police (China),"Protest violently, riot",Shanghai Shi,23015908,SCMP: Crossing the Line,"Days after Shanghai crushed a massive protest against the installation of high-voltage power lines near a housing complex in the suburb of Minhang, residents remain stunned and angry over how police broke up the demonstration using a new weapon.In a rare escalation of tactics for the mainland's commercial capital, police used pepper spray against protesters on November 26 after the crowd swelled to nearly 1,000, some of whom clashed with officers.Whether the incident marked a tougher stance against protesters under the leadership of Shanghai's new Communist Party chief, Yu Zhengsheng, or was an over-reaction by zealous police, is unclear.But what made the protest a landmark was the participation of the middle class in a large-scale demonstration in Shanghai, smashing the traditional compact between the government and citizens, who are expected to remain complacent in return for rising incomes. ""We had a property owner covered in pepper spray,"" said one resident who, like others interviewed, declined to be named. ""We couldn't believe this was how the police 'protected' us. We were very disappointed.""One photo posted on the internet, claiming to be evidence of the incident, showed an officer spraying foam from a canister. Reports that police also used tear gas couldn't be confirmed by some witnesses. The government hasn't commented on the protest.The residents of Holiday Town, where the protest took place, are homeowners with cars and white-collar jobs. Some paid as much as 11,000 yuan per square metre for their flats in the residential compound, built by listed property developer China Vanke Co.The spark for the protest was a combination of a perceived threat to public health and an economic issue, since the installation of power lines would make the area a less desirable place to live and drive down property values.According to several witness accounts, workers from the local power company arrived with security guards and police in the morning. Workers began digging holes for the bases of pylons to string the wires. Although residents were informed of the project last year, no notice was given that work was due to start that day and of the close proximity of the pylons to the residential complex.The protest began soon after, reportedly by elderly people doing their morning exercises. But the numbers increased sharply after people arrived home from work in the evening to find the large holes.More police arrived at about 10.30pm, bringing the total to at least 200. Their ranks included special units of riot police. Scuffles broke out and at least 10 to 20 protesters were arrested. The next day, police locked down the entire area.An international human rights expert said the use of non-lethal weapons such as pepper spray and tear gas by mainland police was uncommon, but not unheard of, although they were more commonly applied against anti-globalisation protesters abroad. ""The police are under instructions not to let things escalate and the use of pepper spray would be an escalation, which would be fairly rare,"" said Nicholas Bequelin, China Researcher for Human Rights Watch.Shanghai typically deals with demonstrations by mobilising large numbers of police, often in plain clothes, to scatter or detain protesters, using vehicles to remove them from the scene.In the wake of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, when the military fired on pro-democracy protesters, China has gradually increased its capability to handle demonstrations through other means. Increasing public protests, coupled with preparations for the Olympics next year, have prompted several cities to establish special units of riot police.In 2005, the Ministry of Public Security announced it was setting up special police units in 36 major cities - including Shanghai - to counter terrorism and other new threats. The units were intended to complement the paramilitary People's Armed Police which also handles domestic disturbances.Shanghai has also started to equip police on the beat with electric batons. In the first recorded use of the tool, reported by local media, an officer used an electric baton on a traffic violator who disregarded an order.In 2005, paramilitary police opened fire on residents of Dongzhou village in Guangdong province in a protest over land appropriation for a power plant. The government claims three people were killed.In what must be a worrisome sign for the government, some of the biggest protests in recent years have been staged by residents of the most wealthy provinces and cities, the main beneficiaries of the economic boom, and not just disenfranchised workers and farmers.Some Chinese academics believe most protests involve land - and developed areas have higher prices, thus increasing the frequency of conflicts. Others believe the middle class is finally finding its voice, as growing wealth brings greater recognition of rights.""People want and expect from the state better guarantees of their rights. If it's a narrow, personal interest then they are ready to fight for it. They will hire lawyers, write letters and try to get the media involved,"" said Mr Bequelin. Three communities in Zhejiang province, the cradle of the nation's private enterprise, staged violent protests against polluting factories in 2005.In the southern city of Xiamen , citizens marched against a planned chemical plant for two days in June. The protests sparked a public hearing about the project, though the decision about whether to move forward rests in the hands of the government.But such protests are focused on individual grievances and don't represent an organised, national movement.In Shanghai, calm has returned to the southwestern district where the protest took place. Although police have withdrawn, there is a heavy presence by security guards, and work on installing the power lines is continuing with the foundations for some pylons now in place. Leaders of the protest movement claim at least 10 communities will eventually be affected.Protesters are turning to two avenues to continue the fight: technology and the law. The internet has played a role since the beginning. Some residents rallied after seeing photos posted on the internet on the day of the protest while they were at work. Although authorities have deleted or blocked some postings, residents have communicated using electronic bulletin boards.A series of short videos of the protest has been uploaded to the video-sharing site YouTube. Shot in the dark by a shaky hand, the footage shows a line of police wearing helmets and equipped with shields. Voices can be heard saying: ""It's innocent to protect our homes"" and ""Release the people"".One of the videos has been viewed nearly 5,000 times. ""Please distribute and report the event and help from all over the world!"" wrote the anonymous poster. Residents have used the government's formal complaint channel to voice their grievances, but with few results so far. They are requesting a public hearing to evaluate the plan. Some suspect the power company has ruled out a plan to run the power lines underground because of the higher cost.Residents are also directing their anger at the developer, China Vanke Co, one of the nation's top property developers, which they claim is failing to protect their rights. The country only recently put in place a law protecting private property.""We will continue to complain to higher authorities about the injustice and bring a lawsuit,"" one organiser vowed.Although the government has stressed the ""rule of law"", the power of the state and drive for economic development tend to trample on the rights of individuals.One resident played down the controversial human rights aspect of the dispute, saying the project was simply a health hazard, even though that argument is based on shaky scientific evidence. ""The government ought to consider the opinions of the masses,"" she said, putting her argument in the typical terms of the Communist Party.The protesters feel empowered by a victory involving another project in the district earlier this year, when the government shelved the extension of a high-speed maglev train link to Hangzhou city which would have passed through Minhang, amid similar concerns over the impact on health and the environment.The local government insists the maglev extension is still in the consultation phase and residents' complaints have rarely managed to halt property and infrastructure projects in Shanghai.Last year, hundreds of Minhang residents blocked a section of a major road for two days in a dispute over their eviction to make way for expansion of the domestic Hongqiao Airport, a project which is proceeding.Activist lawyer Zheng Enchong, who has advised hundreds of Shanghai residents on property-related disputes, said Minhang had been a hotbed of conflict since the 1980s when the city first built a light railway line.Residents had a legal right to question whether the power grid expansion had the proper permits and to demand a public hearing, but winning a lawsuit was another question. ""If many people bring a lawsuit for a good reason, the government might make some small concessions,"" he said.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post (Internet Version-WWW) in English -- Internet version of Hong Kong's most prominent non-PRC-owned English-language daily newspaper.

The protesters accused him and his predecessor, Jian Wenhao, of colluding with developers to illegally evict residents of the three streets - Shamian, Yuqi and Gaodi - in the past few years.They claimed Mr Xie took bribes and disregarded orders from the provincial government and even President Hu Jintao in order to ""build an independent kingdom, ignoring the central government and the law in Guangzhou"".About a dozen police asked the protesters to put the banners away.""Are you really Guangzhou residents?"" a police officer asked one protester.

She said Jinhongshun, a developer, had tried to pull down hundreds of old houses and shops in the street since 2003 to make way for a new business building.Ms Pang said that in order to push ahead with the project, the company started demolitions before getting residents' permission.The project affected about 500 families and, after years of legal wrangling, the Guangdong government in 2006 revoked Jinhongshun's right to use the land.But Ms Pang said that with the support of the city's intermediate court, Mr Xie and the housing bureau, Jinhongshun forged ahead with its construction plans. She said the company sent thugs to harass residents, hoping to frighten them out.Another resident said her home was broken into twice within three months last year.The residents said they suspected the thieves had been sent by the developer because they broke through a bricked-up window to steal several thousand yuan.

Protesters claimed their employer, Japanese-invested Mitani Textile Manufacturing, signed new work contracts on December 30 but declared them invalid the following day.But a company official blamed the dispute on workers, saying they had refused to accept certain conditions in the contract, but gave no details.Workers have staged daily protests outside the glove-making factory in the city's Songjiang district for the past week. But managers apparently called in police yesterday because protesters were blocking the road. Workers claimed police officers hit some protesters and detained more than 10.""Our manager promised he would sign contracts with us before January 7, but he just made us wait for notification without giving us any reply,"" one protester said. ""Today he even called us dogs then called the police.""A new Labour Contract Law, which took effect on January 1, imposes heavy penalties if companies fail to enter into written contracts with full-time employees. It limits the number of fixed-term contracts to two before a company is required to shift to non-fixed terms. Some companies have fired workers to avoid such open-ended contracts.Following scuffles with police at the factory, workers took their grievances to the government's complaint office yesterday afternoon, and waited the rest of the day to speak to officials. Many of the workers are migrants. Shanghai keeps a tight grip on public protests, which are typically sparked by housing evictions. This is the first known protest since the implementation of the new labour law, though some local workers had complained that they were laid off before it took effect - causing the local government to intervene.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post (Internet Version-WWW) in English -- Internet version of Hong Kong's most prominent non-PRC-owned English-language daily newspaper.

Why does the government not listen to our concerns?"" said a protester surnamed Guan, adding the extension would pass within 100 metres (328 ft) of her house.As police cordoned off the city government in People's Square, once home to a race track in Shanghai's colonial heyday, demonstrators took off down the fashionable Nanjing Road shopping area.The protest was the largest the cosmopolitan and wealthy city has seen since thousands took to the streets in sometimes violent anti-Japanese demonstrations in 2005.""I'm marching against the proposed line as it's too close to town. It's going to be noisy and emit pollution,"" said another protester, who would only give his family name, Liu.""If you have a house near the line, you will not be able to sell it for as much money,"" he added.Some demonstrators handed out anti-Nazi resistance poems in German, while others sang the Chinese national anthem.In a prepared statement, a spokesman for the Shanghai city government said authorities had ""persuaded"" the protesters to disperse because they were affecting public order.He said the government was still in the process of showing to the public a proposal for the maglev project, which would help to improve the transport system of the city and the whole country.""We hope city residents will go through legal channels to express their opinions rationally, and not use methods that affect public order,"" he added.The protest gradually dispersed peacefully under a light drizzle in the early evening. The police kept their distance as people left.The country is grappling with an acknowledged rise in unrest, driven by anger at illegal land grabs, corruption, environmental woes and a rising rich-poor gap, though large scale protests in big cities are rare.""Yes, it's an illegal protest. But we've been pushed into a corner,"" said another protester.EXTENSION PLAN ""SAFE""China has the only commercial maglev in operation in the world, developed and built by the government and a German consortium including industrial giant Siemens.Launched in 2003, the maglev floats on a magnetic cushion over a distance of 30 kilometres (18.6 miles) between an outlying part of Shanghai's financial district in Pudong and the international airport.The government wants to extend the train to downtown Shanghai, and then possibly to the nearby tourist city of Hangzhou.An environmental assessment report released by the Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences this month, compiled for the government after complaints by city residents, declared the extension plan was safe.The maglev line would not affect air and water quality, and noise pollution could be controlled, the official Xinhua news agency quoted the report as saying.However, Xinhua also quoted the report as saying a greenbelt buffer zone around the track would only be 22.5 metres wide, though an original blueprint by the local government showed a buffer zone of 150 metres on either side, and German specifications required 300 metres on each side.Authorities planned to limit the maximum speed along the Shanghai section of the route to 200 km per hour, about half of the maglev's speed on the existing section of track from the international airport, Xinhua said.

However, a junior government official said government leaders had gathered to ""discuss the situation.""Last May, Tenglong Aromatic PX (Xiamen) Co. Ltd. was forced to halt construction of a $1.4 billion facility to produce the petrochemical paraxylene in the port city of Xiamen after residents there mobilized by sending more than 1 million text messages warning of possible pollution problems.Several days of protests forced officials there to suspend the project indefinitely.The demonstrations in Dongshan County started after residents heard that the paraxylene factory would instead be built there, about 100 kilometers south of Xiamen.Paraxylene is used in the production of plastics, polyester and film. Short-term exposure to paraxylene can cause eye, nose or throat irritation in humans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Chronic exposure can affect the central nervous system and may cause death.The Communist government has become more sensitive to pollution complaints after numerous accidents in recent years polluted rivers and disrupted water supplies to major cities.The suspension of the Xiamen project also coincided with government efforts to slow an investment boom in industries where output exceeds demand.Witnesses contacted by The Associated Press sent more than two dozen photos and a video showing thousands of people marching down a main street holding up large red banners reading ""We are opposing the PX project which threatens people's health and security"" and ""Rescue Dongshan County.""

According to sources, on 21 March 2008, the Tibetan people from Ponkor Toema and Mema Townships in Darlag County staged a peaceful protest by pulling down a Chinese national flag and replacing it with the banned Tibetan national flag. During the protest, the Tibetans protested against the Chinese authorities who came to the protest scene. The Chinese authorities responded the protest by dispatching five big and small military vehicles to Darlag County on 22 March 2008. While the military vehicles were entering into Darlag County, a group of 350 horsemen charged and blocked the Chinese military vehicles from entering. During the blockage, the Tibetan horsemen protested against the Chinese authorities. On 23 March 2008, the monks of Ponko Monastery and a local religious lama Gurlu intervened and pacified the escalating tension on both sides. On the same day, around 30 Chinese military vehicles came to Darlag County to quell the peaceful protesters. On 24 March 2008, around 50 Tibetans from Ponkor Toema and Mema Township were arrested by the Chinese security forces for taking part in peaceful protest. Later on 25 March 2008, 10 Tibetans and 40 other Tibetans were again arrested. In the backdrop of persistent arrest threats and intimidation by the Chinese security forces, around 400 Tibetans from Ponkor Toema and 100 Tibetans from Ponkor Mema Townships fled and sought hide outs on nearby mountain tops on 26 March 2008. In response, around 860 Chinese security forces have surrounded the mountain from various sides. Days later, the Chinese security forces were luring the hiding Tibetans to surrender by promising leniency in punishment. Ironically on 27 March 2008, two Tibetans voluntarily surrendered themselves to the Chinese security forces but were severely beaten and tortured. Sources told TCHRD that in the following weeks, hundreds of Tibetan protesters were arrested by the Chinese security forces. Many of them, who were later released from the detention, were charged with a hefty fine of 20,000 Chinese yuan as a punishment (US $2,500). On 28 April 2008, events took a dramatic turn when the armed Chinese security forces surrounded a nomadic hamlet in Ponkor Toema Township. At the breaking of a dawn, the armed security forces fired live ammunition on the nomads. Moments later, 22-year-old nomad Choetop was killed during the gun fire. The Chinese security forces took the dead body with them and till date the dead body was not returned to Choetop's family for funeral rites. The situation in Ponkor Toema Township was said to be tense and more and more Chinese security forces were beefing up in Ponkor Township. TCHRD expresses its grave concern over the condition of Tibetan people in Ponkor Township. The Centre calls upon the Chinese authorities to restrain from stepping up restrictive measures and violent crackdown on the peaceful Tibetan protesters."

894,3/28/08,Monastery (China),Other Authorities / Officials (China),Demonstrate or rally,Tibet Autonomous Region,22128906,UK Journalist Describes Monks' Protest on Government-Organized Visit to Lhasa,"The simmering political ?tensions in Tibet burst into the open on Thursday in one of Lhasa's most important temples when a group of 30 young Buddhist monks interrupted a government?organised visit by international journalists to shout about the lack of freedom in the country and in support of the Dalai Lama.The monks were clearly agitated and several wept openly as they accused the Chinese authorities of lying to the visiting journalists and promised further ?demonstrations.""We want a free Tibet, we want a free Tibet,"" shouted one of the young monks, who was crying at the time.The remarkable intrusion of the monks, who acknowledged that they were taking considerable personal risks, undermined a carefully choreographed visit that was designed to show that life was returning to normal in the Lhasa following a wave of protests in Tibetan areas of the city against the Chinese government over the last two weeks.The Financial Times was part of a small group of journalists allowed into the Tibetan capital for the first time since rioting on March 14. With the Olympic Games taking place in Beijing in August, the Chinese government has been under heavy pressure to allow journalists more freedom to operate. The Chinese authorities maintain that the riot and other anti-Chinese protests in recent weeks have been fomented by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.The dramatic intervention by the monks took place in the Jokhang Temple as reporters were being briefed by Quzhe, a monk at the temple and deputy director of its administrative office, who said that the city's ?monasteries were now calm.While he was talking, the younger monks - mostly in their early 20s - pushed in front of the journalists and started to air their grievances. As well as calling for freedom from Chinese rule of Tibet, the monks complained that they had been locked in the temple since the March 14 riot.""We know we will probably be arrested but we have to keep fighting,"" said one of the monks.The group of monks was soon surrounded by security guards and other officials who started shouting for the exchange to stop and tried to pull away some of the reporters. Several journalists were eventually dragged away from the site to prevent them from talking further with the monks. The monks also claimed that the heavy security presence around the temple had been withdrawn only for the media visit and said many of the people inside the inner sanctum of the temple were not genuine worshippers but had been brought in to the temple by officials to make it seem as if normal religious life had returned to the capital.On several other occasions on Thursday and on Wednesday, access to the area around the temple was completely blocked off by police. The city's other main monasteries, Drepung, Sera and Ramoche, were also surrounded by police with the monks locked inside.? Baima Chilin, vice-chairman of the Tibetan government, denied that the authorities had artificially created the impression that the temple was busy and said the monks would not be arrested for their actions. However, he revealed that of the 414 people arrested in Lhasa since the riot, some were monks.Caught off guard While China has faced international criticism for its tough response to the wave of protests and riots that have swept Tibetan areas over the last two weeks, in Lhasa the authorities are under attack for reacting too slowly.The Tibetan capital suffered the worst rioting it has seen in decades on March 14 and some of March 15 after four days of more peaceful protests that were led by monks. Yet with the official death count from the riot now 18, many residents believe the local authorities delayed far too long before stopping the violence.The sentiment is particularly strong among Han Chinese, who bore the brunt of the riot which was mostly conducted by Tibetans. ""There were buildings all around the place on fire andpeople with knives,"" said a Chinese resident of the old Tibetan quarter surnamed Yang who was forced out of his home. ""Yet for hours, the only thing we saw was a few policemen."" Police officers injured in the riot said that in the early stages they only had modest equipment. The reason for the delay is still unclear. One theory holds that the region's leading politicians were still in Beijing at the time attending the National People's Congress, slowing decision-making. Others contend that officials were reluctant to send in heavily armed troops a few months before the Olympics. Still others suggest the police were too busy monitoring the city's main monasteries to respond to the riot. Whatever the explanation, the slow response reinforces the impression that the authorities were caught off guard by the mood of the Tibetan population.[Description of Source: London FT.com Financial Times in English  website of Financial Times, authoritative centrist daily focusing on international economic and political news, comment, and analysis; read by policymakers and business leaders around the world; URL: www.ft.com]",London FT.com Financial Times in English,Tibet,"Lhasa, Ramoche Monastery,  Tsuglag-khang (Jokhang) temple",17,1000,"mass protests in Lhasa on Saturday as foreign diplomats visited the tense city following recent deadly unrest over Chinese rule.

It also said the villagers were armed with knives and were hurling sticks, rocks and bricks at police when the shots were fired.Five policemen were injured while quelling the unrest, according to the government statement, which added that order had been restored in the village.According to the rights network, the villagers had not agreed to compensation offered by the Zijin Mining Group, one of China's major mining companies, and were incensed when construction of the tungsten mine went ahead.Clashes erupted after police and mining company officials began taking away video cameras from the villagers, most of whom were members of the Miao ethnic minority, the rights network added.Armed police, including border police used to patrol the nearby frontier with Vietnam, had been brought in to maintain order by the state-owned mining company with the approval of the local government, the network said.Government officials in Yunnan province refused to comment on the incident when contacted by AFP.Land disputes have been an acute social problem in China in recent years, with villagers and farmers often complaining about poor compensation packages in land-use deals usually brokered between the government and developers.But it is rare when news is released that police have used lethal force to quell protests over land disputes.In December 2005, police in southern China's Guangdong province opened fire on protesters in Dongzhou village, killing at least three people as peaceful demonstrations against a government land grab there turned violent.Separately, police clashed with some 6,000 villagers, mostly of the ethnic Li minority, in Hainan province in southern China between April 9 and 13, the rights group said.The villagers were protesting about insufficient compensation for land that was being confiscated to build a golf course, it said.

933,4/12/08,Citizen (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Guangdong Sheng,22097491,"HK Paper Reports on Villagers, Police Clash in China Over Land Requisition","Serious clashes between the government and the local people occurred yesterday in Leliu Town, Shunde, Foshan City. Dissatisfied with the recent detention of their representatives by the public security authorities, over 1,000 people from Renhai Village in Leliu went to demonstrate in front of the town government building yesterday morning, demanding the release of the detained representatives. In addition to the demonstration, they stormed the town police station. Finally, the incident turned into a serious physical clash, in which 18 villagers were injured, including four in serious condition. At lease one police officer was also injured in the clash. According to the local government, the incident of storming the government department was a result of instigation by a few people with an ulterior motive. The incident started at a little after 8 am yesterday when over 1,000 villages set out from Renhai Village for the Leliu Town Government and Police Station to stage a demonstration. Their purposes was to ask the police authorities to release the detained representatives. On their way to the destinations, they chanted slogans and held banners. At 9:30 am, they arrived at the town government and sat in front of the government building. The police authorities dispatched some 400 shield-holding riot police to the spot to meet emergency requirements, if any. During this period, the villagers sent 10 representatives to negotiate with the town government. The representatives demanded that the police release the detained villagers unconditionally, but their demand was rejected. At about 12:30, after the family members of six detained villagers had again talked with the government but without success, the angry masses of villagers began to storm the town government. At that time, they had physical clashes with the riot police, numbering several hundreds. This attracted more than 1,000 onlookers and caused a serious traffic jam in the highway in front of the town government building. The police used tear gas, shields, and clubs to disperse the villagers. The Villagers Demanded the Release of Their Representatives; 19 People Were Injured The clash lasted nearly half an hour. Then, the villagers were dispersed. The incident resulted in 18 villagers being injured, four of them in serious condition. Most of the injured had wounds on their heads, bellies, backs, and limbs due to injury by hard objects. Many villagers reportedly wore helmets when demonstrating in front of the town government building, but they were still badly beaten and their faces were covered with blood. Also injured was a plainclothes police officer, whose injured hand required about two dozens of stitches. An official of the Information Office of the Leliu Town Government has told this paper that, during the incident, the office facilities of the Neighborhood Office and the signboard of the night watch pavilion were smashed and damaged. Some office cadres were beaten and injured by the villagers. The reason for the clash, this official said, was that the villagers did not understand the criterion for compensation for the land that the government had requisitioned for building the power-transmission pylons. According to him, this power-transmission line was very important to easing the strained situation of power supply in the locality and in Foshan. The compensation to the local villagers given by the government was three times higher than the compensation offered by power companies. Recently, the police just acted according to law to summon and detain those villagers who had participated in the incident of sabotage by arson at the end of last year. As to yesterday's clash, it was due to instigation by a few people with an ulterior motive.[Description of Source: Hong Kong Tung Fang Jih Pao (Internet Version-WWW) in Chinese -- Internet version of Non-PRC-owned daily newspaper (Oriental Daily News); targets a mass readership with emphasis on local and south China news but takes no strong political stands.

938,4/16/08,Children (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Shandong Sheng,22088072,"Zhongguo Wang: Carrefour Boycott, Sophisticated CNN","A girl stages a lone boycott demonstration in front of a Beijing Carrefour on April 13, 2008. Looks like the Carrefour boycott has already begun even though the proposed date on the Internet is May 1, a national holiday in China. A girl staged a lone boycott demonstration in front of a Beijing Carrefour supermarket on April 13, on the same day that several residents demonstrated before a Carrefour in Qingdao, in eastern China's Shandong Province. Both were seen as the starting point of a campaign against French enterprises wanting to enrich their businesses in the Chinese market. A group of demonstrators protest before the Carrefour in city of Qingdao, Shandong Province, April 13, 2008. Yesterday, some 30 Chinese demonstrated before a Carrefour in Kunming, Yunnan Province. The organizers brought a 20-meter banner that read: ""Support the Olympics; no independence for Tibet; boycott French goods; boycott Carrefour"". The event lasted from 10 AM to 2 PM with police maintaining order along the avenue. Hundreds of passers-by signed their names on the banner. The Carrefour boycott is one of the boycott appeals that have emerged from the Internet a few days ago as Chinese people watched TV and noted disgraceful disturbances regarding the Olympic torch parade in London, Paris and San Francisco. Many young Chinese blame the chaos on mismanagement by local authorities; others blame various politicians and the media for fanning anti-China sentiments among the foreign public by distorting facts on Tibet and ignoring Chinese voices. French riot police grapple with a demonstrator trying to grab the Olympic torch in Paris April 7, 2008. (REUTERS) The Paris stop was singled out because Chinese officials had to change the plan and extinguish the torch five times for security reasons. An image of the disabled female torch bearer, Jin Jing, who suffered under attacks by several Tibetan separatists who tried to grab the torch but failed at that time, triggered widespread Chinese anger that resulted in the current nationwide boycott calls circulating around the Internet, mobile phone messages and chat rooms. ""That may be why Paris lost its bid to hold the Olympics,"" one patriotic Chinese student quipped to China.org.cn, commenting on how Parisan authorities were unable to effectively manage the street disaster. The Internet message accuses French enterprises such as Carrefour and Louis Vuitton of backing the Dalai Lama. Carrefour dismissed the claims. French brands such as Carrefour, Louis Vuitton, L'Oreal and some famous French cars were also included in the boycott list. A fresh statement sent by Carrefour China this morning expressed their thorough support for the Olympics, stating that they never did in the past and will never in the future do anything ""to harm Chinese people's feelings"". Carrefour said they would reserve the rights to initiate legal actions against any individuals and organizations that spread ""unfounded"" and ""malicious"" rumors against it. Witnesses told China.org.cn that at least in Kunming and Beijing these last two days, consumers were noticeably fewer than usual. Some 30 demonstrators protest before the Carrefour in city of Kunming, Yunnan Province, April 15, 2008. One student surnamed Wu in Kunming said that the boycott was not meant to cause trouble, but rather to send a clear message to the outside world: ""If anyone dares to challenge our sovereignty and dignity, they will witness our Chinese united power to fight back! We must stand up this time. 'Love our motherland' will no longer be simply empty words."" When asked about the French goods boycott, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told the French side to think about and reflect upon all the Chinese people's opinions and feelings that had been expressed recently. ""All these actions are by no means accidental,"" she said, believing ""these people will abide by laws and regulations in expressing their reasonable appeals."" Whether to boycott French goods or not is being hotly debated among the Chinese public these days. Bai Yansong, a famed Chinese TV host and a torchbearer expected to hold the flame in Sanya, Hainan Province, wrote in his blog, stating that he will stay away from the boycotts. One logo for the Carrefour boycott campaign?is circulating on the Internet. ""Many may not go to the supermarket that day (May 1), but I'm sure many also will go. We should not punish ourselves for others' mistakes,"" he said, adding that most staff members in Carrefour China are Chinese, and goods sold in Carrefour are almost all made in China. ""It's like an internal conflict."" Bai represents one of the vast numbers of people who would ""love the country rationally"" without enlarging the negative impact between Chinese and French people. They believe China should be wise, generous and tolerant to some anti-China actions because China should start to adopt a superpower manner because it has already holds an unshakable position inside the international community. ""What's the difference between 'boycott French goods' and 'boycott the Olympics?'"" some folks wonder, asking if China should seal itself off from the world again by boycotting a certain number of foreign nations' goods. Also, pro-Tibet activists exist in every Western country. Jin Jing comes back to her hometown Shanghai, April 13, 2008. Even Jin Jing, now a national heroine for protecting the torch from activists in Paris, has said ""no"" to boycotts. ""People should be careful when they hear calls for boycotts,"" she said. ""We will hurt ourselves."" Several boycott calls have happened before: when Chinese and American jets clashed in 2001 and when the Japanese wanted to join the UN's Security Council in 2005. But all of these incidents caused little impact on either side because globalization represents the merging of international manufacturing and sales. The French ambassador will come to China.org.cn for a live online talk show, expecting to ease some Chinese anger. Stay tuned. CNN the sophisticate Atlanta-based American cable TV CNN once again threw out a sophisticated response after the Chinese people, some American-Chinese, and even the Chinese government, accused it of racist and vicious attacks on Chinese in a TV program called ""Situation Room"" that aired on April 9. CNN quickly responded by issuing a statement, ""It was not Mr. Cafferty's nor CNN's intent to cause offense to the Chinese people, and CNN would apologize to anyone who has interpreted the comments in this way."" So what is its intent to smear China over and over again? CNN still seems not realize its credibility is bankrupt concerning the Chinese. The annual most popular phrase among Chinese citizens has already been set: ""Don't be too CNN"", which means don't be such a hypocritical liar when you deal with others. A song, bearing the same catchy phrase, was composed and sung by an amateur singer on the Internet and has since gained popularity. Anti-cnn.com, a grass-roots website, was set up to provide abundant evidence to prove that CNN and some other Western media lie when reporting China's affairs. Jack Cafferty Although CNN holds strong to its self-claimed ""objective and balanced news"", which seems like a joke now, surely they must understand it is not only about how many facts they reported, but also about how many facts they ignored, as well as what words and phrases they deliberately and carefully select, all of which can be used to manipulate public opinions and mock China. Jack Cafferty clarified his words on Monday that his phrase: ""bunch of goons and thugs"" referred to the Chinese government. This was a childish and unprofessional move that attempted to alienate the Chinese government from the people. But let's look back at his comment, as it reads in the CNN transcript, ""We're in hock to the Chinese up to our eyeballs because of the war in Iraq, for one thing. They're holding hundreds of billions of dollars worth of our paper. We are also running hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of trade deficits with them, as we continue to import their junk with the lead paint and the poisoned pet food and exports, you know, jobs to places where you can pay workers a dollar a month to turn out the stuff that we're buying from Wal-Mart. So I think our relationship with China has certainly changed, I think they're basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they've been for the last 50 years."" People might wonder how the Chinese government could produce the ""junk"" and ""poisoned pet food"", referring to several individual cases that happened last year? Ask any Chinese whether the Chinese government represents Chinese people, especially in the current episode of history when patriotic Chinese rally closer around the government? If Chinese and its government are ""goons and thugs"", as he said, then what about the government who invades nations from Iraq to Afghanistan and has killed hundreds of thousands of local civilians for decades? Jiang Yu, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Cafferty, by slandering China and the Chinese people, has ""seriously violated journalistic ethics and gone against the conscience of a normal human being, which reflects his arrogance, ignorance and hostility"". Actually, this represents a pan-China hatred as well as fear for a new emerging superpower, a power that holds different beliefs and political systems from his, yet is always friendly with any peoples from any continents on the planet. His main point, indeed hidden in his bias and malicious remarks, is that China is ""holding hundreds of billions of dollars"" of the US paper deficits while more and more American consumers are ""buying from (inexpensive) Wal-Mart"". ""We are truly stunned and shocked by a recent racist and hatred remark on the Chinese people by your news commentator Jack Cafferty, "" the Legal Immigrant Association, mainly comprised of people from China, launched an online petition (www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/signed.cgi?cnncaff ) condemning the program after it was aired. The petition urged CNN to take immediate action against the commentator and demanded an official apology from CNN to all Chinese people. Nearly 66,000 people who had, in CNN's statement - ""interpreted the comments in this way"", signed it as of Wednesday afternoon.

But activists have seized on it, disrupting the relay in several cities including Paris, London and San Francisco.In Paris, the relay on April 7 descended into chaos, with protesters grabbing for the flame and forcing security officials to repeatedly snuff out the torch and transport it by bus past demonstrators yelling ""Free Tibet!""Some Chinese feel the protests were an attack on their country. Those nationalist feelings were amplified by the popularity of Jin Jing, a disabled fencer who became a household name after stubbornly clinging to the torch while a Tibet supporter tried to wrestle it away during the Paris relay.Anti-French sentiment in China also has grown since French President Nicolas Sarkozy said last month he is considering not attending the Olympic Games opening ceremony because of China's crackdown on Tibet.In Paris, thousands of pro-China demonstrators staged a protest Saturday in support of Beijing. Many of the protesters, who demonstrated at the Place de la Republique, wore T-shirts emblazoned with the phrase ""Let's make the Olympics a bridge, not a wall"" in French.So far, China appears supportive of the views taken against Carrefour, but there are also signs that Beijing is attempting to calm some of the nationalistic spirit.An editorial in Xinhua, which was featured prominently Saturday on Chinese online news portals, was titled: ""The best way to love your country is to do your job well."" Chinese should concentrate their energy on helping to build the Chinese economy, the editorial said.Beijing has blamed recent violence in Tibet, which broke out March 14, on the Dalai Lama and his supporters. China said 22 people died in rioting in the Tibet capital of Lhasa.The Dalai Lama's government-in-exile denies any involvement in the violence.

Chinese media did not immediately report the incident.The Tibetan government in exile and the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy say they have received reports of Thursday's protest in Qinghai province from multiple sources.The sources said 22 Buddhist monks demonstrated peacefully in Rebkong (Chinese: Tongren) County for the release of fellow monks, from a monastery Rong Gonchen arrested for an April 13 protest.After police arrested the 22 monks, hundreds of monks and other Tibetans gathered to demand their release.

The report said the central government has provided more than $3.5 million for the work.Chinese security officials say weapons and explosives were found at Tibetan monasteries in the neighboring provinces of Gansu and Sichuan.But Tibetan exile groups say that firearms discovered were donated by Buddhists as a sign that they had given up hunting.The Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet has released a translation of comments made by monks who disrupted an official media tour of Labrang monastery in Gansu province.

It also said the villagers were armed with knives and were hurling sticks, rocks and bricks at police when the shots were fired.Five policemen were injured while quelling the unrest, according to the government statement, which added that order had been restored in the village.According to the rights network, the villagers had not agreed to compensation offered by the Zijin Mining Group, one of China's major mining companies, and were incensed when construction of the tungsten mine went ahead.Clashes erupted after police and mining company officials began taking away video cameras from the villagers, most of whom were members of the Miao ethnic minority, the rights network added.Armed police, including border police used to patrol the nearby frontier with Vietnam, had been brought in to maintain order by the state-owned mining company with the approval of the local government, the network said.Government officials in Yunnan province refused to comment on the incident when contacted by AFP.Land disputes have been an acute social problem in China in recent years, with villagers and farmers often complaining about poor compensation packages in land-use deals usually brokered between the government and developers.But it is rare when news is released that police have used lethal force to quell protests over land disputes.In December 2005, police in southern China's Guangdong province opened fire on protesters in Dongzhou village, killing at least three people as peaceful demonstrations against a government land grab there turned violent.Separately, police clashed with some 6,000 villagers, mostly of the ethnic Li minority, in Hainan province in southern China between April 9 and 13, the rights group said.The villagers were protesting about insufficient compensation for land that was being confiscated to build a golf course, it said.

1014,5/5/08,Citizen (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Beijing Shi,8814008,Hundreds protest against China chemical plant,"BEIJING, May 5 (Reuters) - About 200 people staged a rare protest in a city in southwest China against construction of a major petrochemical complex, saying it would lead to serious air and water pollution, local media reported on Monday.Protesters in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, marched peacefully for about two hours on Sunday to demonstrate against plans for an ethylene plant and an oil refinery on the city's northern outskirts, the Beijing News said.""Because of fears that these two projects, when finished, could seriously pollute Chengdu's air and water resources, the people 'took a stroll' to express their opposition,"" the paper quoted an unnamed resident as saying.Ethylene is a commonly used industrial compound in packaging and insulation. It can be toxic in large doses and lead to nausea, loss of memory and even death.Construction had begun on one of the projects, the paper said, which would be located about 35 km (22 miles) north of Chengdu's city centre.The ethylene plant was slated to produce 800,000 tonnes of ethylene a year. The refinery, which would refine 10 million tonnes of crude a year, had been approved last month by the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top planning agency, the paper said.The projects were expected to provide more than than 20,000 jobs, the paper said, citing an unnamed expert. The protesters were orderly and did not shout slogans or carry banners, the paper said.Protests against pollution and official abuse of power are common across China's vast countryside, but dissent is rarely voiced openly in more affluent cities.But along with rising property ownership, increasingly tenacious urban residents have become less tolerant of breakneck development, and have successfully organised to halt a number of controversial government-backed projects in recent years.Authorities in commercial capital Shanghai have shelved an extension to the city's high-speed ""maglev"" train after hundreds of people marched through city streets in January, saying they feared the train could emit radiation and bring down the value of their homes.Last year, thousands of street protesters in Xiamen, a resort town on China's southeast coast, lead authorities to abandon plans for a paraxylene plant on the outskirts of the city.

1034,6/4/08,Citizen (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Sichuan Sheng,11923453,Chinese battle for return to normality after quake.,"CHINA:THE ARDUOUS process of rebuilding earthquake-struck swathes of Sichuan province continues, with hundreds of bodies being buried deep underground to stop possible epidemics and moves afoot to get children back to school in the areas worst-affected by the quake over three weeks ago.In some places, life is returning, if not to quite back to normal, at least to something approaching normality - more than 500 students and teachers of a middle school in Wenchuan, at the epicentre of the 7.9-magnitude quake on May 12th, have moved in a mobile school and resumed classes.However, for many parents of schoolchildren, no normality is possible. Scores of parents of students who died in the Juyuan Middle School were dragged away by riot police after they protested outside a courthouse in Dujiangyan, angry at the poor building standards in the school.The parents had been kneeling in front of the courthouse yelling, ""We want to sue"". The quake destroyed 7,000 classrooms, and parents in Dujiangyan and at other schools where students were killed believe that the schools were badly built and did not stand a chance when the earthquake struck at 2.28pm, a time when many children were at school.One of the most common rumours doing the rounds in the earthquake zone has been that such a large number of dead would lead to major disease outbreaks.This has prompted at times eccentric, fearful behaviour, with taxi drivers refusing to fill their petrol tanks near the worst-affected areas saying the petrol had been contaminated, and people avoiding any food from the area.A health ministry spokesman said that in cases where bodies crushed under buildings in the tremor could not be cremated, the corpses had been buried deep underground and far from water sources to prevent contamination.""Theoretically, when there is a large movement of people, the risk increases for the spread of transmittable diseases. We have the ability and the confidence to guarantee there will be no epidemics after the disaster,"" Mao Qunan said in a web broadcast.Tent camps had been disinfected and people warned of health risks, he added. The official death toll is 69,107, with 18,230 people still missing, the State Council said. The earth quake also left five million people homeless.Distributing tents and setting up temporary housing before the onset of the rainy season is a priority. Football stadiums and other public areas around the zone are filled with tents, but with heavy rain approaching, the focus now shifts to making pre-fabricated housing, which is less inclined to leak in heavy rain.The earthquake zone is a hive of activity, with the centre of co-ordination the Sichuan capital, Chengdu. Soldiers continue to unblock the roads around the province, clear rubble and deliver food to communities still isolated by the quake. The soldiers are backed up by squads of volunteers from all over China and abroad, who are travelling the area delivering food and water to refugees from the quake.The relief effort remains a hazardous task. A military helicopter carrying survivors and rescuers which crashed three days ago was still missing in the wilds of Sichuan. The Mi-171 transport was carrying 19 people, 14 of them people injured in the quake, when it crashed in fog near Wenchuan on Saturday.Teams of engineers are also trying to clear ""quake lakes"" formed by landslides following the quake. At Tangjiashan, a lake formed by the landslide above Beichuan, the water level had risen to dangerously high levels, threatening flooding in towns and villages downstream, but troops were able to clear a channel for water to flow away.The earthquake is still top news in China, and so far donations from home and abroad have reached 41.7 billion yuan (?380 million).Doing your bit for the earthquake victims is seen as a matter of doing your duty, and corporate donors are stepping up with major donations, both of cash and expertise.There are events going on all over the country to raise funds - US pop group Black Eyed Peas are holding a concert in Shanghai to raise money for the victims.In the devastated county of Wenchuan, building workers travelled from southern Guangdong province to build a large temporary school.College entrance exams are coming up all over China this month, a big event when everyone focuses on the crucial three-day matriculation examinations for entry to university.The main focus of the new school building in Wenchuan is to allow 300 students preparing for the entrance exams to resume their studies.",NA,Sichuan,Dujiangyan,14,100,"The new measures appear to scale back some of the media freedoms granted after the May 12 earthquake, which has killed almost 70,000 people.

Now, the new rules appear to limit access to the areas where parents have been protesting.

Parents said the dormitory was locked, giving the children no chance to escape.They also said the dormitory, a former hospital built in the 1960s, did not meet safety standards and the children died as a result of poor construction or corruption.Even with official quake-zone interview passes, reporters have been barred from entering the town of Muyu since last week, in an apparent effort to control media coverage of the tragedy.Anguished Muyu parents previously trapped Mr Li in his car for a day until he promised a thorough investigation. But they were further infuriated on June 9 when the government sent out ""a letter to the parents"" revoking the investigation promise.Parents said the government letter, a printout with no official stamp or signature, was difficult to verify and they wanted an official government statement with Mr Li's signature so that they could use it as evidence in a lawsuit or an official complaint.Under heavy police watch, more than 60 parents of dead students went to the county government office yesterday morning demanding to see Mr Li, but they were barred from going near his tent office.Some left in the afternoon, but after days of unmet demands for justice, some became emotional.As she was led away by a policewoman, one mother shouted: ""You corrupt officials don't deserve to be parents.

The riot, lasting from yesterday afternoon to the early hours of today, was triggered by the unjust treatment of a case in which a 16-year-old girl was killed by the relatives of Public Security Bureau officials. The demonstrating masses set fire to the buildings of the county Public Security Bureau and Government Office. Twenty vehicles were burned and destroyed, including 12 police vehicles. The Guizhou provincial authorities summoned some 1,500 armed police and riot police from various places and sent them to the spot to suppress the riot. In clashing with the police, one of the demonstrators died, and more than 150 injured. This morning the police was still searching and arresting the demonstrators. Over 200 people were arrested, including 30 secondary school students. According to information obtained by this center, a 16-year-old secondary school girl in Weng'an County was raped and killed last week. Her family said that she had disappear after being called away by three young men. The county Public Security Bureau summoned the three young men for interrogation. Despite their serious suspected charge of homicide, they were released after 24 hours' detention because two of them are relatives of officials of the Public Security Bureau. The family of the dead placed the girl's remains in a public place to protest against the Public Security Bureau's act of shielding the suspects. The police tried twice to take over the remains and cremate them but in vain. Meanwhile, two of the family members were beaten and injured by the police. At noon yesterday, about 500 secondary school students went to the Public Security Bureau to petition, but were driven away and beaten up. Upon learning this, the masses of this county were overwhelmed with indignation. A riot ensued, involving 10,000 people. Twenty government vehicles, including 12 police vehicles, were overturned, burned, and destroyed. Some people began to set fire to the buildings of the county Public Security Bureau and Government Office. By the evening, more and more armed police and public security police had arrived from various places. The police began to arrest the demonstrators. Some policemen fired guns into the air. Information obtained so far indicates that, in clashing with the police, one of the demonstrators died, and more than 150 were injured. Some of the injured are still in the hospital. From last night to 10 a.m. this morning, the police arrested more than 200 demonstrators. Now, they are still searching and arresting the demonstrators on the basis of the video record. The above news and figures were provided to us by five informed sources. This is the largest-scale riot that has occurred this year in this country. While the strictest security period for the Olympic Games has begun, and all localities are strictly controlling small demonstrations, such a large-scale riot has broken out. This is indicative of the fact that China's social contradictions may be triggered at any time. With the continuous slide of the stock market on the mainland, the possibility of a big turmoil in China before the Olympic Games cannot be ruled out.

2584,7/14/08,Protester (China),Police (China),"Protest violently, riot",Zhejiang Sheng,11783164,"Hundreds of migrant workers riot in eastern China, attacking police station","BEIJING (AP) - Hundreds of migrant workers attacked a police station in eastern China after one was allegedly beaten while trying to get a residence permit, highlighting enduring tensions between temporary workers and authorities.The three days of unrest in coastal Zhejiang province began Thursday when a crowd gathered in front of the Kanmen town police station to protest the treatment of the beaten worker, with some demonstrators throwing rocks at officers, the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday.The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said the crowds burned police cars and motorcycles, demanding the release of the worker who was detained after complaining that police allegedly beat him over a quarrel about his application for a temporary residence permit.""The government employees told me that I could not be registered without my identification card. I quarreled with them and they hit me on my head,"" Xinhua quoted the worker, Zhang Zhongfu, 34, as saying.Police, however, said the Sichuan resident bumped his head against a wall while drunk.The unrest underscored abiding tensions over China's tens of millions of migrant workers who have left the poor countryside to look for work in cities. They often settle in urban areas in violation of the nation's strict household registration -- or ""hukou"" -- system, which technically bars rural residents from moving to cities.The riots came just two weeks after a crowd of 30,000 people in southwest China set fire to a police station over what many believed was an official cover-up of the circumstances surrounding the death of a teenage girl.Such incidents, often triggered by allegations over corruption and official abuses, have been an embarrassment to the leadership, especially before next month's Beijing Olympics.Chinese officials downplayed the violence in Zhejiang, saying an investigation was under way.A woman who answered the telephone at Kanmen's public security bureau said she saw the demonstration but denied that the workers broke into the police station or burned vehicles. The woman, who did not give her name as is common with officials in China, said they only gathered on the streets, shouting.Three policemen were injured in the unrest, which continued on Friday and Saturday, according to Xinhua.The agency reported, however, that order had since been restored and 23 of the protesters were detained. The Hong Kong rights organization put the number at 30.Three hundred military police arrived in Kanmen Sunday, said the chief of the propaganda department of Yuhuan County, which oversees Kanmen. He gave his family name as Yan.He said Zhang was drunk when he was trying to get his residence permit and ""knocked his head on the wall by himself.""Yan said Zhang has been freed but gave no details.China imposed the residency rules shortly after the 1949 communist revolution as part of tight controls on where people could live, work, and even whom they could marry.The system required migrants to carry their residency papers and exposing them to police abuse and extortion. The rules were reformed after the 2003 beating death of a young college graduate who was detained for not having a residence permit.Migrants no longer have to carry residency papers on them, police can no longer forcibly detain them and temporary residency fees have been slashed, although abuses are sometimes reported.But Phelim Kine, an Asia researcher with New York-based Human Rights Watch, notes that traveling workers do not enjoy social benefits, such as unemployment services and access to medical care, that urban residents do because of a household regulation system.""This is a de facto apartheid system,"" Kine said.Migrant workers, who usually perform the lowest-paid and most dangerous jobs, also have little legal recourse in disputes with employers because of a widespread lack of labor contracts.""This incident illustrates the types of abuses that migrant workers in China are prey to; that they lack legal status, and in this case, an attempt to gain this legal status results in physical violence,"" said Kine.Human rights groups have also said while migrants are allowed to apply for temporary residency, they must pay extra for schooling and rarely receive insurance or access to subsidized housing.Also Monday, Xinhua said police in Guizhou province had detained 100 people, including 39 members of local gangs, for their role in last month's protest over the death of the teenage student.Peng Dequan, vice director of provincial public security, was quoted as saying they were still looking for other ""gangsters"" who were in hiding.Authorities have accused local gangs of fomenting the unrest, and have urged offenders to surrender and encouraged local residents to give information on others suspected of organizing it, Xinhua said.------Associated Press writers Cara Anna in Shanghai, China, and Carley Petesch in New York contributed to this report.",AP,Zhejiang,Kanmen town police station  Yuhuan county,14,1000,"Migrant Workers: About 1,000 migrant workers broke windows at a police station and threw stones at officers during three days of protests in the eastern province of Zhejiang after a migrant was hurt in a dispute with authorities last week, Xinhua and a human rights group said yesterday.The incident in Yuhuan county marks the second time in less than a month that protests against the government have turned violent - at a time when the central government wants to preserve its image for the Olympics.Last Wednesday, a migrant worker from Sichuan province named Zhang Zhongfu sought to apply for a temporary resident permit, but an argument broke out and he was beaten by police, the Hong Kong-based Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy said.Xinhua also reported the incident last night. Under the headline ""Hundreds of migrant workers attack police office in E. China"", Xinhua said the riot lasted for three days and left three officers injured.Xinhua did not say whether anyone was arrested, but it confirmed the human rights group's report as to why the riot had broken out.Sichuan is a major source of migrant labour to the rest of the country, and Zhejiang is a centre of private enterprise, which has made the province wealthy.The main industries in Yuhuan county, south of Taizhou , are fish farming and manufacturing.On Thursday night, Mr Zhang returned with several others to demand justice. The group threw stones at police officers, damaged police vehicles and obstructed officers from duties, the Yuhuan government said.Protesters damaged six police motorcycles, causing fuel to leak out. Three officers were injured. Authorities detained 23 people.On Friday night, more workers came, surrounded the station and demanded that the people be released, but police dispersed them.On Saturday, the number of protesting workers started in the dozens but swelled to more than 1,000. They surrounded the police station, throwing rocks to smash windows and damage other property. Once again authorities cleared the crowd.More than 300 People's Armed Police, a paramilitary force, were patrolling the area. Local officials said only one person had been arrested and the rest had been released on bail, but the human rights group disputed that claim.The government defended its handling of the incident, saying it was necessary to ""maintain social stability"". It said the situation was now calm.Local officials took a tough stance at a news conference on Sunday. They acknowledged migrant workers had made contributions to the economy but said the new residents - estimated in the thousands or even tens of thousands - had put pressure on societal management.""We will investigate to the end, will strike severely and will not be soft-hearted,"" said Weng Zhengui , the county's deputy police chief. Officials denied rumours that people had been killed in the clashes.On June 28, tens of thousands of residents of Wengan in Guizhou province stormed government and police offices over what they believed to be a cover-up of the rape and murder of a teenage girl, allegedly by the son of a local official.The government said the girl committed suicide and blamed the protests on public dissatisfaction caused by crime and corruption.

1072,7/17/08,Citizen (China),Government (China),Demonstrate or rally,NA,9272783,Protesting Parents and Police Clash in China,"BEIJING -- Hundreds of parents protesting shoddy school construction that they said led to the deaths of their children in the May earthquake were harassed by riot police officers on Tuesday and criticized by local government officials, the parents said Wednesday.Local officials were also trying to buy the silence of the parents by offering them about $8,800 if they signed a contract agreeing not to raise the school construction issue again, several parents said.The confrontation between the parents and the police officers erupted on Tuesday morning as 200 parents protested outside government offices in Mianzhu, a city in the earthquake-ravaged Sichuan Province, said Liu Guangyuan, a protester who lost a son when a school collapsed.It was the latest in a series of protests held by grieving parents, many of whom lost their only child in the earthquake. With an eye to the approach of the Olympic Games in Beijing next month, however, the Chinese authorities have ordered the police to crack down on the rallies. Chinese news organizations have also been told by the central government not to report on the schools, and all journalists have been barred from approaching the collapse sites.The parents in Mianzhu on Tuesday were demanding that the government offer a full report on why Dongqi Middle School collapsed, killing at least 200 of the school's 900 students.The Chinese government has reported that a total of 7,000 classrooms collapsed during the May 12 earthquake, and by some estimates 10,000 of the nearly 70,000 confirmed deaths were of schoolchildren.In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, many local governments promised to investigate the school collapses, but parents across Sichuan Province complained that they had yet to receive any reports.The parents of the Dongqi schoolchildren gathered at 10 a.m. and demanded to meet the mayor, but no officials came out for any serious discussion, said Mr. Liu, a carpenter.Instead, an official, saying that the parents were violating public security laws, ''ordered us to leave within two minutes,'' Mr. Liu said. ''Then the riot police started pushing and dragging. Some of the outraged parents got into physical confrontations with the police. I saw eight or nine parents carried away to patrol cars parked on the side.''Mr. Liu said he had heard that the parents were taken to a police station, but it was unclear exactly what happened to them.A person answering the telephone at the Mianzhu government offices on Wednesday said officials were in a meeting and could not talk to reporters.Mr. Liu said that the parents of Dongqi students were offended by the offer of money from the Sichuan provincial government if they agreed to drop the issue. The amount ''is far from enough to appease the grief,'' he said.Mr. Liu said the parents of children who attended Dongqi Middle School would petition their case at higher levels of government.Dongqi Middle School was built in 1975 and renovated in 1981, Mr. Liu said. ''When my son entered the school in 2006, they promised to build new buildings,'' he added. ''This was written in the enrollment welcome letter. But they didn't keep their word, and then the earthquake happened.''Zhang Longfu, whose daughter died in another Mianzhu school that collapsed, said parents at that school had also been offered $8,800 plus a pension upon retirement in their 60s if they signed a contract acknowledging that their children died in the schools because of the earthquake and agreeing not to disturb reconstruction efforts.''Parents are generally concerned about the contract and are not willing to sign it because they're afraid that by signing it, they'll be admitting that their children's deaths are not related to the shoddy school building,'' said Mr. Zhang, whose daughter died in the collapse of Fuxin No. 2 Primary School.Mr. Zhang said some leaders of the parents group met on Tuesday with the vice mayor of Mianzhu, who he said acknowledged that the schools were poorly built and had some hidden safety problems but insisted that the earthquake was ultimately responsible for the collapses.Hundreds of parents also held a rally on Tuesday in Shifang to protest government attempts to give them compensation in return for silence, according to a report from Radio Free Asia, a nonprofit news agency that receives financing from the United States government. The report said that the local government was offering to hand out $14,600 to each household in which a child had died in a school collapse.",NA,Sichuan,Mianzhu,7,200,"Hundreds of parents protesting shoddy school construction that they said led to the deaths of their children in the May earthquake were harassed by riot police officers on Tuesday and criticized by local government officials, the parents said Wednesday.Local officials were also trying to buy the silence of the parents by offering them about $8,800 if they signed a contract agreeing not to raise the school construction issue again, several parents said.

2590,7/18/08,Citizen (China),Police (China),"Protest violently, riot",Jilin Sheng,21927880,Mob Storms Guangdong County Police Station over Death of Motorcycle Operator,"Guangzhou, 18 Jul (Xinhua) -- A mobincident took place this morning at Yuanzhou, a town in Boluo County inGuangdong's Huizhou City, as result of the death of a passenger motorcycleoperator. More than 100 relatives of the deceased stormed the police station, thevillage party committee office and an emporium; and the local governments hadto send for the riot police to maintain order. The mob dispersed shortly after1300 the same day. Currently, the local publicsecurity authorities, at the request of the family members of the deceased, arewaiting for the arrival of a legal medical expert from Hunan, where thedeceased had his domicile registered, to appraise and ascertain the cause ofthe death. According to the Boluo County PartyCommittee office, the town's traffic police received a call at 0427 on 17 July,and the caller said that he saw a motorcycle lying near a gas station in thetown's Xingyuan Road, and that somebody was hurt. The police rushed to thescene at 0440 to investigate the incident. Later a Yuanzhou Hospital doctorconfirmed at the scene that the motorcycle operator had died. The police thenstarted to collect evidence by asking questions and taking pictures. But whenthey were about to remove the motorcycle and the body from the road aftercompleting the inquest, the townsmen of the deceased stopped them from doing so.Subsequent investigations showedthat the deceased, surnamed Ouyang, was from Hunan. His family members, afterarriving at the scene shortly after 0700, claimed that the deceased was beatento death by members of the public security squad of Shangnan Village. They insistedthat the body must not be removed until the murderers were captured. Then thenumber of onlookers grew and, at one time or another, over 100 people,including family members and townsmen of the deceased and those who were misinformed,stormed the Zhongyuan police station, the Shangnan Village Party Committeeoffice, and the nearby emporium. They also overturned a police vehicle of theYuanzhou Police Station. After the incident occurred, DengQingzhong, secretary of the Boluo County party committee, instructed the policeto investigate the cause of the incident so as to calm down the emotionalmasses. County Magistrate Wang Sheng and other county and town leaders andpersonnel of departments concerned also arrived at the scene to direct thehandling of the case. The riot police that the county sent for to maintainorder also detained seven ringleaders. Shortly after 1300 on that day, theonlookers gradually scattered. The county's criminal police and traffic police thenmoved the body to the county funeral parlor. Meanwhile, at the request of thedeceased's family members, they are waiting for the arrival of a legal medicalexpert from Hunan, where the deceased had his domicile registered, to come toappraise and ascertain the cause of his death. The county has also formed threegroups to handle the aftermath -- one to investigate the incident, one tomaintain public order, and one to mollify the deceased's family members. According to a witness, who is astaff worker at the county party committee office, he saw a brake mark over 30meters long at the site where the incident occurred, and it could be theindication that the motorcycle operator was speeding at that time. He said thedeep wound on the deceased's skull could be the cause of his death. An official of the Boluo Countyparty committee indicated that it was investigating the following matters -- whetherthe death was caused by traffic accident or by what the deceased's familymembers' claim that he was beaten to death by public security members; whetherthe deceased had any dispute with members of the Shangnan Village publicsecurity squad; whether the local vehicle authorities followed the regulationsfor managing passenger motorcycles; whether the deceased was stopped or chasedby public security personnel; and whether the public security personnel hadtried to collect protection fees from the passenger motorcycle's operator. ?

Following Guizhou's Weng'an and Guangdong's Huizhou, where disturbances happened earlier, Guangxi's Qinzhou City saw as many as 1,000 common people demonstrate outside the city government office a few days ago and at least 10 arrested. In the rubber farmer disturbances in Yunnan's Menglian County, which left two people dead and 55 wounded, there was still an assembly of a few hundred common people by yesterday morning [20 July] and a few hundred public security police were present to keep a lookout to prevent further disturbances. Chinese constitutional scholar Chen Yongmiao pointed out that popular discontent in the inland has reached the point where ""dry firewood is everywhere"" and would erupt at any time once there is tinder.In Qinzhou City, it is reported, more than 1,000 jobless workers and peasants who had to relocate to make way for new construction gathered in front of the local city government office's entrance on the 15th of this month over state-owned enterprises' ownership system reform, labour contracts, and issues in demolition and relocation due to land requisition that badly affected their livelihood and demanded that the officials resolve them. People Held Back by Armed Police Personnel, At Least 10 ArrestedWhen they were about to go to the city government office to express their support, a few hundred peasants were held back outside the city by Armed Police personnel and a dozen were arrested in the incident. Local officials came forward at that time to have a dialogue with the demonstrating public and promised to resolve the issues; only then did the public peacefully disperse.As for Menglian County's Dongma Town, where rubber farmer disturbances happened on the 19th, the Xinhua News Agency said that by 10.00 a.m. yesterday there was still an assembly of more than 200 rubber farmers outside the Dongma Rubber Company but the incident was already coming to an end.The day before yesterday more than 1,000 rubber farmers at Menglian's Dongma Town - out of discontent over forced land requisition and unfair compensation by the authorities as well as rubber procurement and other issues - went to the local Dongma Rubber Company's entrance to demonstrate and clashed with the more than 100 public security personnel present. Two rubber farmers were killed and another wounded by police fire. At least 55 people were wounded and 20 arrested in the incident. Public Security Bureau Building Explodes in HebeiAccording to information from the Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, in addition, Hebei Province's Guangzong County Public Security Bureau exploded on the morning of the ninth of this month and tens of rooms in the building were shattered and at least 10 people wounded. After the incident happened, the local government imposed a news blackout. The explosion is suspected to have been caused by bombs planted by villagers discontented with the public security bureau.In the face of the successive occurrence of several sanguinary conflicts and massive popular protests, Chen Yongmiao indicated: These disturbances did not happen by chance but were caused by some local governments' prolonged violation of popular interests, the gradual diversification of social contradictions, and the failure to defuse contradictions between the common people and the government through economic development. These contradictions have brought popular discontent to the point where ""dry firewood is everywhere"" and ""could kindle at any time once there is tinder.""Source: Ming Pao website, Hong Kong, in Chinese 21 Jul 08","Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao, in Chinese",Guangxi,Qinzhou city,2,1000,"In Qinzhou City, it is reported, more than 1,000 jobless workers and peasants who had to relocate to make way for new construction gathered in front of the local city government office's entrance on the 15th of this month over state-owned enterprises' ownership system reform, labour contracts, and issues in demolition and relocation due to land requisition that badly affected their livelihood and demanded that the officials resolve them.

The first week after the end of the Beijing Olympic Games, a fairly large-scale mass demonstration took place yesterday in Changying and Guanzhuang Areas of Beijing's Chaoyang District. More than 100 residents gathered and demonstrated on Chaoyang North Road and protested against the severe pollution to the environment and by the government's waste incineration factory, which has poisoned the residents of the region. The demonstration stopped the traffic of Chaoyang North Road for three hours. The authorities ordered a large batch of police officers to be on the alert. It is claimed that beating incidents have occurred. Burning 1,600 Tons of Waste DailyThe reason for the demonstration is that a strong foul odor has emanated from the large waste processing factory near Changying and Guanzhuan Areas, and the level of carcinogen, such as dioxin, found in its incinerated waste is 10 times higher than the average. A resident of Bolin Aiyue Community in Chaoyang District said that in addition to a medical incinerator, the factory's incinerators burn more than 1,600 tons of domestic waste everyday. The toxic dioxin produced by the incinerators has made hundreds of thousands of residents live breathing the poisonous gas. It is reported that the residents have been complaining about this issue for many years, but the government has not made an explanation yet. Moreover, the authorities planned to construct million square meters of low-cost housing and two-limit housing (imposing limit on the housing price and space). Some demonstrators said that the government did not consider the health and safety of the ordinary people at the grassroots level when it enacted the policy. They now stand forward to express their opinions is not for themselves but for the heath of the people who will move into the community in the future.

Rail and road services had reopened.The website said executives of the Fuda Property Development Company were ""under control"", apparently referring to their detention, and officials would investigate to help investors get their money back.It said provincial armed forces chief Wang Xiaorong had arrived in Jishou to oversee public security and armed police dealing with the demonstrations. The Hong Kong-based Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy said at least 50 protesters had been injured and 20 people detained, including a local news photographer. But officials said no one had been injured and police had detained only nine ""lawless people"".The centre said yesterday morning that 5,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers from the Hunan military region had been sent to Jishou to patrol the railway station and downtown area.It said the unrest indicated the extent of underground fund-raising activities in the region in which up to 150,000 people had invested in illegal schemes in the prefecture of 2 million people.Netizens in Xiangxi said many residents, even civil servants, the unemployed and elderly had put money into such schemes because of a lack of other investment opportunities and low interest payments by banks.A research report posted on a Tianya.com forum said local officials had encouraged private companies to expand through public fund-raising but had failed to set up monitoring systems. It said that between 2004 and 2006 at least 50 companies had raised at least 20 billion yuan (HK$22.82 billion) illegally for various projects with promises to pay investors 30 per cent interest monthly. But in June, the prefectural government banned civil servants from participating in such schemes, causing a withdrawal of investment funds of at least 300 million yuan in July and early last month. That caused an immediate financial crisis for some companies, with some closing down and others forced to decrease interest rates. That angered many people.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English -- Website of Hong Kong's most prominent non-PRC-owned English-language daily newspaper; URL: http://www.scmp.com]",Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English,Hunan,"Xiangxi prefecture government in Hunan, Jishou",4,10000,"http://au.epochtimes.com/gb/8/9/4/n2252392.htm         The protesters blocked main roads and trains in Jishou, the seat of the prefecture, on Wednesday and Thursday to demand government action after a finance-raising property development company failed to pay investors the high interest rates it had promised, according to a statement on the prefectural government website.

More than 1,000 workers staged a demonstration yesterday [ 8 October], blocking the Jinke bridge highway in Zhejiang's Shaoxing city. As a result, the company issued an urgent announcement yesterday on suspending its stock trading for 1400 hours. The global financial turmoil is impacting China's economy. Some of the enterprises that depend on banks overseas and funds raised by the public at home will go bankrupt, increasing the danger of social turmoil in China.This center has been informed that more than 1,000 workers blocked the Jinke bridge highway since nine o'clock yesterday morning, paralyzing traffic that involved over 100,000 people. Hundreds of public security officers were on guard along the highway but no conflicts occurred. The protesters dispersed at around?one o'clock in the afternoon. The company issued an urgent notice to the Singapore Stock Exchange at two o'clock yesterday afternoon on suspending its stock trading for 1400 hours. The company is one of the largest dyeing mills in China. Faced with capital shortages recently, the company is likely to go bankrupt in the near future. The company has failed to pay workers' salaries for one to six months and is also behind in payment of 200 million yuan to suppliers. High level officials of the company have disappeared and they might have left the country.There are reports saying that China will subscribe to $200 billion of US treasury bonds, which has evoked great attention of the people at home. China has been criticized for the management and use of its foreign exchange reserves. The global financial turmoil has seriously impacted Chinese enterprises that depend on lending from overseas banks. Bankruptcy of these enterprises will lead to large numbers of workers losing their jobs, which will further aggravate turmoil in China.

Hundreds of anti-riot police were dispatched to the scene to guard against any possible turmoil. The Yiwu Choucheng Police Station confirmed the incident but refused to disclose which country the foreigner came from. This center has learned that around 1930 hours last night, a foreigner knocked down a local resident on a motorbike while he was driving a car and dashing through the red light near the Honglou Guesthouse in Chouzhou Road. Instead of extending an apology, the foreigner used his cell phone to hit the resident's head, making him bleed all over his face. The move evoked anger of the masses, who overturned the foreigner's car and started to smash it. Hundreds of police rushed to the scene to save the foreigner. When learned that the foreigner was released instead of being detained, over 1,000 residents besieged the Choucheng Police Station that was responsible for handling the incident, demanding an explanation. The residents dispersed at around 2100 hours. The Choucheng Police Station confirmed the incident but refused to comment on which country the foreigner was from and why the police station did not fine the foreigner for beating the local resident. A staff member of the Honglou Guesthouse told us that the Chouzhou Road, the busiest part of Yiwu city, was sealed for half an hour. The situation was tense when over 1,000 residents gathered there and hundreds of police were on guard. Only a few months are left till the 20th anniversary of the 4 June incident. China's social situation seems to be more or less similar to the one 20 years ago. The greatest similarity is that the people are dissatisfied and have no place to vent their discontent. If an unrest takes place, providing an opportunity for the pent-up grievances to burst out, the masses will take an active part to air their discontent and grievances.

It was supposed to green the desert,"" said a Beijing resident surnamed Li, who lost about 100,000 yuan in the scheme.""The company planted about 720,000 mu (48,000 hectares), but about 40 percent died,"" Li added.The scheme, which saw some farmers transfer their land to the company to use for its plantations, has shone the spotlight on China's recent rural reforms, which will allow farmers to transfer their land-use rights.China's rural residents own the product of their land but not the land itself and were barred from trading their land-use rights.The state-owned land system, a hangover from the huge collective communes set up under Mao Zedong, is routinely abused by local governments who often seize rural plots to sell to factories or developers, often paying only minimal compensation to farmers.State media have hailed the reforms as a landmark step in guaranteeing farmers' rights and boosting the country's agricultural output through larger, more efficient farms.Protesters welcomed the reforms, but expressed doubts that they would protect rural residents from opportunistic officials.""Of course, these reforms are beneficial. But there needs to be more public supervision otherwise people will keep getting cheated,"" said a Beijing resident who declined to leave his name.($1=6.828 Yuan) (Editing by Bill Tarrant)",Reuters,Beijing,government office ,2,100,"The state-owned land system, a hangover from the huge collective communes set up under Mao Zedong, is routinely abused by local governments who often seize rural plots to sell to factories or developers, often paying only minimal compensation to farmers.

1131,11/12/08,Citizen (China),Government (China),Demonstrate or rally,Hainan Sheng,22369015,China Daily: Reform in Taxi Management,"The unreasonable taxi management system is the root cause of recent strikes by taxi drivers, says an article in China Youth Daily. The following is an excerpt:On Nov 10, hundreds of taxi drivers in Sanya, Hainan province, halted operations and gathered at the gate of the municipal government, demanding the government solve problems such as high management fees, rampancy of unlicensed taxies and contract terms.These problems have already troubled taxi drivers in Chongqing, who went on strike earlier this month. It is no secret that high management fees or the charges paid to taxi companies are a common problem in domestic taxi industry. If this problem could only be solved through strikes, the cost would be too high and it would also set a bad example for solving social problems.The taxi could have been independently run by a taxi driver and the management of taxies could have been fully handled by the passenger transport office affiliated with the local traffic management bureau. It is similar to what a small business owner should do when opening a shop- he or she only needs to register at the local government department, that monitors the administration of industry and commerce. They do not need to be attached to any trade association or to pay any management fees.From this perspective, taxi companies are a completely unnecessary link. It is this link that extracts quite a large part of the money earned by taxi drivers with their hard toil. However, this unreasonable system has been here for years and across the country backed by certain interest groups.As taxi companies repeatedly raise the management fees despite dissatisfaction of taxi drivers and the rising conflicts between the two sides, extreme reactions such as strikes are inevitable. We urgently need a reform of taxi management in China.[Description of Source: Beijing China Daily Online in English -- Website of China's official English-language newspaper, offering both the website of the paper and additional content; URL: http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/]",Beijing China Daily Online in English,Hainan,Sanya city government,4,200,"taxi On Nov 10, hundreds of taxi drivers in Sanya, Hainan province, halted operations and gathered at the gate of the municipal government, demanding the government solve problems such as high management fees, rampancy of unlicensed taxies and contract terms.

We will also take resolute measures to crack down on the illegal taxis,"" he said.Su also revealed that about 30 drivers had complained to the government that they were unwilling to go on strike, but they were forced to do so by some other drivers. Yet Su did not say how the government will treat the issue.In the neighboring city of Jieyang, taxi drivers have rallied on a square in front of a railway station since Wednesday morning, protesting the same issues as those in Chaozhou.They also called for establishing a drivers' association and reducing rental fees paid to the taxi companies.Almost 100 taxis and their drivers were still gathered on the square on Friday and dozens of drivers also protesting outside the municipal government building.No violence was reported, but protesting drivers complained that about four or five of them were hurt by police on Wednesday afternoon when they were told to disperse. The local police declined to comment on Friday.""We are protecting our legitimate interests and not asking too much. I think it won't be difficult for the government to satisfy our demands,"" a driver surnamed Liu told Xinhua.The city reports 895 licensed taxis, said Yang Jianwei, deputy head of the Jieyang Municipal Transport Bureau.""We haven't added more taxis since 2003, and actually, we have no plan to increase the number of taxis even now,"" Yang said. ""The reason why we do so is just to protect their interests and reduce competition.""He said local authorities have been committed to cracking down on illegal taxis in recent years.""We will continue to resolutely crack down on unlicensed taxis,"" he said.In addition, Yang said the local authorities would help set up a taxi drivers' association to offer a channel for them to file their complaints.He said some drivers had been forced to take part in the strike, like those in Chaozhou, but he did not elaborate.Huang Shuili, vice mayor of Jieyang, said the government was studying other demands by the taxi drivers.Strikes are rare in China, but several taxi strikes have been reported this month in Chongqing, Sanya, Yongdeng and Shantou over high rental fees and unlicensed taxis.Taxi drivers in those towns resumed work after the local authorities promised to reduce rental fees and resolutely crack down on illegal taxis.

The officer then punched the man when he refused to let him go.A squad of more than 100 armed police was sent in after the bystanders smashed the motorcycle.The blogger wrote that the armed police had beaten many of the people involved, which only inflamed the situation.The mainland's migrant labourers are one of the most vulnerable sections of society and have been on the receiving end of much of the fallout from the global economic downturn in recent months.This month, the Ministry of Agriculture said up to 20 million migrant workers, or 15.3 per cent of the 130 million strong migrant workforce, had lost their jobs.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English -- Website of Hong Kong's most prominent non-PRC-owned English-language daily newspaper; URL: http://www.scmp.com]",Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online,Zhejiang,Zhejiang city of Tongxiang,14,5000,http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/9/2/17/n2432004.htm

Some government staff were slightly injured"", the report added. Calm had returned to the area, Xinhua said.The official website of the Tibetan government-in-exile based in the north Indian town of Dharamsala (www.tibet.net) said about 4,000 people clashed with Chinese police over the suicide of a Tibetan monk from the Ragya monastery.It said protesters carried the Tibetan national flag and banners, and shouted ""Independence for Tibet"" and ""Long Live His Holiness the Dalai Lama"".The Xinhua report said six people were arrested and 89 had ""surrendered"", most of them monks at the Ragya monastery.A local official was quoted as saying a search for monks who took part in the assault would continue.The report said Zhaxi Sangwu had ""managed to run away from the police station on Saturday on the excuse of using the bathroom"". The man apparently swam across a river to escape and was still missing.The tibet.net report identified the monk as Tashi Sangpo, 25, and said he was involved in removing the Chinese flag and unfurling the Tibetan national flag over the monastery's main prayer hall on March 10. Sangpo committed suicide on Saturday fearing his arrest, it said, quoting sources from Tibet.The report said Chinese forces were maintaining a strict vigil and had locked down the monastery.Protests by Buddhist monks on March 14 last year led to the deaths of 19 people and sparked waves of protests in Tibetan areas. Tibetan exiles say more than 200 people died in the crackdown.A year later, a tight web of troops and police throughout Tibetan areas appeared to have deterred large-scale unrest.A trickle of isolated protests in recent weeks, including a monk who set himself on fire at the Kirti monastery in western Sichuan and a bomb thrown at a government office which caused no casualties, suggested lingering discontent.Earlier this month, Tibet's self-exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama lamented that Tibet, which he fled 50 years ago, had become a ""hell on earth"" thanks to repressive Chinese rule.He said support for Tibet in China was growing steadily.

Protesters told the newspaper a government representative agreed to meet some of them but that the talks were disappointing.Protests are common all over China, but demonstrations by middle-class homeowners are rare. Authorities have sought to tread carefully among such groups who want a say in protecting the homes, jobs and other benefits that rising living standards have afforded.The state-run Shanghai Daily said the homeowners massed outside the government office of Shanghai's suburban Minhang district, the location of the Lotus Riverside apartment compound.Calls to the information office of the Shanghai municipal government rang unanswered Sunday.The toppled building is an embarrassment for Shanghai, a showcase city of 20 million in the midst of a construction boom as it prepares to host the 2010 World Expo.The protest delayed a planned meeting between the homeowners and the developer to discuss compensation.Government officials who attended the meeting said they could only guarantee payments to owners of units in the building that fell, the Shanghai Daily reported. Buyers of apartments in the development's other buildings have also sought refunds because they fear the entire complex is unsafe. The report said compensation awards would be announced in the coming days.The building fell because piles of dirt were excavated to build an underground parking garage, according to initial investigation results reported Friday.Unusually aggressive reports by the state-controlled media have centered on possible collusion between the property developer, the contractor and others supervising the work.Earlier this week, the government said nine people were ""under supervision"" in connection with the investigation.",AP,Shanghai,government building,2,100,"Hundreds of Chinese homeowners protested outside government offices in Shanghai demanding refunds after a 13-story apartment building in a complex under construction toppled over, newspapers reported Sunday.

1215,7/5/09,Protester (China),Police (China),Demonstrate or rally,Beijing Shi,11969869,Uighur exile says Chinese fired indiscriminately,"An exiled leader of China's Uighur minority said Sunday that Chinese police fired indiscriminately on Uighur protesters in the country's Xinjiang province.Alim Seytoff, general secretary of the Uighur American Association, added that he feared the toll was more than the three dead reported by Beijing.Seytoff strongly disputed Beijing's assertion that rioters attacked members of the Han majority, saying Uighur students held a peaceful protest in the northwestern city of Urumqi, the capital of China's Xinjiang region.The Xinjiang University students were seeking the arrest of suspects behind an ethnically charged brawl late last month at a factory in southern China that left two Uighurs dead, Seytoff said.""These young Uighurs peacefully took to the streets but more than 1,000 armed Chinese police came out,"" Seytoff told AFP.""What we were told is that they began to shoot indiscriminately,"" Seytoff said.""More than three were killed, but we don't know how many. Hundreds of others were injured.""The exiled Uighur group released pictures and footage on the video-sharing website YouTube purporting to show a heavy-handed police response.One video shows a large crowd marching and chanting on a street as cars honk their horns in support. In another, plumes of smoke rise from a building as what sound like gunshots are heard.One photo distributed by the exiled movement appears to show six bodies on the ground on a dark street. Another photo shows three people lying on the ground in what seems like a different location.One close-up picture shows a man with a stream of blood coming from his head.Seytoff, who said he was in contact with Urumqi residents, said Chinese authorities had turned off lights in part of the city and were entering dormitories.""They are doing a door-to-door search and arresting those Uighurs who were part of this peaceful protest,"" Seytoff said.Seytoff is also spokesman for the World Uighur Congress, led by Washington-based exile Rebiya Kadeer, which Chinese authorities accused of involvement in the unrest.Seytoff said the Chinese account was ""an absolute mischaracterization"" aimed at justifying a police crackdown.China's official Xinhua news agency said that Uighur rioters had ""illegally gathered"" downtown and went on a spree of smashing and looting. Xinhua said that three people were dead and that they were Han Chinese.But Seytoff said the protesters sought justice over the factory brawl and also wanted China ""to treat the Uighurs with respect for their language, their culture and their way of life.""""Their key demand is that the Chinese government give up its brainwashing of the Chinese people into racism against the Uighurs as enemies,"" he said.The US State Department in its most recent report said China has stepped up political and religious repression of the Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim people.China says it is trying to reduce the income gap between Xinjiang and coastal regions by encouraging companies in the country's manufacturing hubs to hire Uighurs.On June 26, a brawl broke out at a factory making toys in Shaoguan, in the southern province of Guangdong. Chinese state media said authorities broke up the fight and pledged to find the perpetrators.But Uighur protesters said no one has been punished over the incident, which Seytoff said was set off by rumors of Uighurs raping Chinese women.sct/sah/arb",NA,Xinjiang,Urumqi,16,10000,"Uyghurs university students: Protesters from a Muslim ethnic group clashed with police in China's far west Sunday, with activists saying police fired shots in the air and used batons to disperse a crowd that had swelled to nearly 1,000.State media said at least three ethnic Han Chinese were killed, while an activist group said one demonstrator may have died.

1228,7/7/09,Protester (China),Police (China),Demonstrate or rally,Xinjiang Uygur Zizhiqu,12021786,China Seals Off Cities Battered by Ethnic Fight,"URUMQI, China -- The Chinese government locked down this regional capital of 2.3 million people and other cities across its western desert region on Monday and early Tuesday, imposing curfews, cutting off cellphone and Internet services and sending armed police officers into neighborhoods after clashes erupted here on Sunday evening between Muslim Uighurs and Han Chinese. The fighting left at least 156 people dead and more than 1,000 injured, according to the state news agency.But hundreds of Uighur protesters defied the police again on Tuesday morning, crashing a state-run tour of the riot scene for foreign and Chinese journalists. A wailing crowd of women, joined later by scores of Uighur men, marched down a wide avenue with raised fists and tearfully demanded that the police release Uighur men who they said had been seized from their homes after the violence. Some women waved the identification cards of men who had been detained.As journalists watched, the demonstrators smashed the windshield of a police car and several police officers drew their pistols before the entire crowd was encircled by officers and paramilitary troops in riot gear.''A lot of ordinary people were taken away by the police,'' a protester named Qimanguili, a 13-year-old girl clad in a white T-shirt and a black headscarf, said, crying. She said her 19-year-old brother had been taken away by police officers on Monday, long after the riots had ended.The confrontation later ebbed to a tense standoff between about 100 protesters, mostly women, some carrying infants, and riot police in black body armor and helmets, tear-gas launchers at the ready, in a Uighur neighborhood pocked with burned-out homes and an automobile sales lot torched during the Sunday riots.The fighting on Sunday was the deadliest episode of ethnic violence in China in decades. The bloodshed here, along with the Tibetan uprising last year, shows the extent of racial hostility that still pervades much of western China, fueled partly by economic disparity and by government attempts to restrict religious and political activity by minority groups.The rioting, which began as a peaceful protest calling for a full government inquiry into an earlier brawl between Uighurs and Han Chinese at a factory in southern China, took place in the heart of Xinjiang, an oil-rich desert region where Uighurs are the largest ethnic group but are ruled by the Han, the dominant ethnic group in the country.Protests spread Monday to the heavily guarded town of Kashgar, on China's western border, as 200 to 300 people chanting ''God is great'' and ''Release the people'' confronted riot police officers about 5:30 p.m. in front of the city's yellow-walled Id Kah Mosque, the largest mosque in China. They quickly dispersed when officers began arresting people, one resident said.Internet social platforms and chat programs appeared to have unified Uighurs in anger over the way Chinese officials had handled the earlier brawl, which took place in late June thousands of miles away in Shaoguan, Guangdong Province. There, Han workers rampaged through a Uighur dormitory, killing at least two Uighurs and injuring many others, according to the state news agency, Xinhua. Police officers later arrested a resentful former factory worker who had ignited the fight by spreading a rumor that six Uighur men had raped two Han women at the site, Xinhua reported.But photographs that appeared online after the battle showed people standing around a pile of corpses, leading many Uighurs to believe that the government was playing down the number of dead Uighurs. One Uighur student said the photographs began showing up on many Web sites about one week ago. Government censors repeatedly tried to delete them, but to no avail, he said.''Uighurs posted it again and again in order to let more people know the truth, because how painful is it that the government does bald-faced injustice to Uighur people?'' said the student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from the government.A call for protests spread on Web sites and QQ, the most popular instant-messaging program in China, despite government efforts to block online discussion of the feud.By Tuesday morning, more than 36 hours after the start of the protest, the police had detained more than 1,400 suspects, according to Xinhua. More than 200 shops and 14 homes had been destroyed in Urumqi, and 261 motor vehicles, mostly buses, had been burned, Xinhua reported, citing Liu Yaohua, the regional police chief.Police officers operated checkpoints on roads throughout Xinjiang on Monday. People at major hotels said they had no Internet access. Most people in the city could not use cellphones.At the local airport, five scrawny, young men wearing black, bulletproof vests and helmets stood outside the terminal, holding batons. The roadways leading into the city center were empty early on Tuesday, except for parked squad cars and clusters of armored personnel carriers and olive military trucks brimming with paramilitary troops. An all-night curfew had been imposed.Residents described the central bazaar in the Uighur enclave, where much of the rioting took place, as littered with the charred hulks of buses and cars. An American teacher in Urumqi, Adam Grode, and another foreigner said they had heard gunfire long after nightfall Sunday.Xinhua did not give a breakdown of the 156 deaths, and it was unclear how many of them were protesters and how many were other civilians or police officers. There were no independent estimates of the number of the death toll. At least 1,000 people were described as having protested.Photographs online and video on state television showed injured people lying in the streets, not far from overturned vehicles that had been set ablaze. Government officials gave journalists in Urumqi a disc with a video showing bodies strewn in the streets.The officials also released a statement that laid the blame directly on Rebiya Kadeer, a Uighur businesswoman and human rights advocate who had been imprisoned in China and now lives in Washington. It said the World Uighur Congress, a group led by ''the splittist'' Ms. Kadeer, ''directly ignited, plotted and directed the violence using the Shaoguan incident in Guangdong.'' The statement said bloggers first began calling for the protest on Saturday night and also used QQ and online bulletin boards to organize a rally at People's Square and South Gate in the Uighur quarter of Urumqi.The World Uighur Congress rejected the accusations and said that it condemned ''in the strongest possible terms the brutal crackdown of a peaceful protest of young Uighurs.'' The group said in a statement on Monday that Uighurs had been subject to reprisals not only from Chinese security forces but also from Han Chinese civilians who attacked homes, workplaces or dormitories after the riots on Monday.The violence on Sunday dwarfed in scale assaults on security forces last year in Xinjiang. It was deadlier, too, than any of the bombings, riots and protests that swept through the region in the 1990s and that led to a government clampdown.Uighurs make up about half of the 20 million people in Xinjiang but are a minority in Urumqi, where Han Chinese dominate. The Chinese government has encouraged Han migration to many parts of Xinjiang, and Uighurs say that the Han tend to get the better jobs in Urumqi. The government also maintains tight control on the practice of Islam, which many Uighurs cite as a source of frustration.But an ethnic Han woman who lives in an apartment near the central bazaar said in a telephone interview that the government should show no sympathy toward the malcontents.''What they should do is crack down with a lot of force at first, so the situation doesn't get worse, so it doesn't drag out like in Tibet,'' she said after insisting on anonymity. ''Their mind is very simple. If you crack down on one, you'll scare all of them. The government should come down harder.''PHOTOS: Urumqi residents on Monday walked past burned cars.

Up to a thousand residents of Fengxiang, in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, clashed with police yesterday outside a lead smelter they believe has poisoned more than 600 children.While they were tearing down fences and blocking roads outside the smelter following three days of peaceful protest, a court hundreds of kilometres away passed sentences on two polluters that may signal a tougher approach to the problem, which plagues towns and cities across the mainland.For the first time, prosecutors charged two managers of a polluting factory with discharging toxic substances - rather than a lesser offence usually punished by a fine - and a Jiangsu court jailed them for six years and 11 years respectively. The official Xinhua news agency called it a judicial landmark.The Fengxiang villagers had been demonstrating since Friday to press for more help from local authorities. Yesterday, the protesters tried to break into the Dongling Lead and Zinc Smelting plant and tear it down. The local government called in riot police, who clashed with the crowd outside the smelter. Protesters stoned vehicles entering and leaving.""I saw more than 1,000 people blocking the roads and railway. They shouted and demanded the government demolish the factory,"" said a man working at a petrol station 400 metres away who saw the protest unfold.""The government did not give them any concrete answer, only promising that it will speed up relocation plans. The crowds are getting emotional,"" the witness said.There was no immediate word on injuries or arrests. Police, local officials and company staff refused to comment on what had happened.The protest comes weeks after hundreds of villagers in Liuyang, Hunan province, laid siege to a local government office after tests showed 500 had suffered heavy-metal poisoning. The villagers blamed it on toxic waste discharged by a plant producing indium, a heavy metal used in liquid crystal displays.In Yancheng, in the eastern province of Jiangsu,Jiangsu, a court heard that Hu Wenbiao and Ding Yuesheng, two managers of the Biaoxin chemical company, had dumped toxic chemicals hydroxybenzene - which causes cancer - and phenol into a nearby water source for 16 months. In February, water supplies to 200,000 people were shut off because of the chemical contamination.The court sentenced Hu to 11 years for the pollution and falsifying receipts, and Ding to six years. The maximum penalty for discharging toxic substances is death. Previously, polluters have been charged with causing serious environmental pollution and, in most cases, only fined.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English -- Website of well-respected non-PRC-owned daily newspaper and Hong Kong's most prominent English-language daily; features extensive original reporting on Hong Kong and PRC political issues and an even-handed editorial line; URL: http://www.scmp.com]",Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English,Shaanxi,"Baoji city, Fengxiang",5,1000,"http://hk.crntt.com/doc/1010/5/2/9/101052976.html?coluid=7&kindid=0&docid=101052976               2,000 riot police fired tear gas and warning shots in Quanzhou, as demonstrators protested against foul stench and cancer ratesChina's pollution controls have failed to keep pace with economic development, the country's environment minister has admitted as details emerged of another riot sparked by fears of industrial contamination.In at least the third clash in as many weeks, 2,000 riot police fired tear gas and warning shots during a violent confrontation with anti-pollution protesters near an industrial plant in Quanzhou, Fujian Province.The demonstrators destroyed cars, threw stones at police and took an official hostage last weekend in an attempt to sabotage a tannery and chemical plant that they blamed for a foul stench and high rates of cancer.

""Why are we not allowed to stay here?""Sometime during the night, the protesters verbally clashed with police officers after park guards asked the large group to leave the premises.A video of the protest was later posted at tudou.com, resulting in strong debates among local citizens.""But, we eventually got the police to leave the park,"" Ah said. The park, according to both the police and the organization, is a popular gathering spot for male homosexuals. About 100 gay people meet there each day, Ah said.A police officer with the Guangwei subdistrict public security station, who declined to be identified, said the move to ask homosexuals to leave the park was a preventive measure because gay people are allegedly committing crime in the park.""An increasing number of local citizens have told us they have been harassed by gay people in the park,"" the unnamed officer said.The officer also said homosexuals are committing minor crimes such as robbery and stealing.""We can hardly distinguish those who have harassed local citizens. That is why we have to push all of them out,"" he said.Ah Qiang refuted the police officer's claim and said that male homosexuals are the victims of crimes, not the perpetrators. Many gay people are robbed in the park, he said.""Police should protect us from being victims of such crimes, instead of pushing us away,"" said Ah, who added that fewer gay people dare to enter the park after the police's recent action.Ah said his group has about 30 volunteers in Guangzhou and they go to the park to educate others about safe sex.""We also have discussions with gay people to behave decently in the park. Otherwise, they will be pushed away by police given the city's strengthened efforts to prepare for next year's Asian Games,"" he said.Some gay people and volunteers were questioned in the park's public security house for several hours before the protest, he said.""As far as I know, all people who were questioned in the public security house have been set free,"" Ah said.(Copyright 2001 by China Daily)",China Daily,Guangdong,Guangzhou People's Park,14,100,

Reuters reported that hundreds of Han Chinese tried to push their way through security barriers to a Uighur neighbourhood earlier in the morning.The protests come two months after inter-ethnic violence in Urumqi claimed almost 200 lives and injured 1,700. Many demonstrators are angry that July's rioters have not yet stood trial and have targeted Xinjiang's hardline Communist chief, Wang Lequan, calling for his resignation.Xinhua said yesterday's protests involved tens of thousands of people, including Uighurs, and followed reports that assailants were attacking people with syringes.It added: ""Stabbing attacks occurred [again] during the protests and an attacker was caught at the scene. The police stopped the crowd who were about to beat her.""Li Zhi, the Communist party boss of the city, has claimed the needle attacks were part of a separatist plot to create conflict, Xinhua reported.""This was a grave terrorist crime ... The goal was to create ethnic division and stir up ethnic antagonism in a bid to overturn social order, split the motherland and split the Chinese nation,"" he said.Uighurs make up almost half of Xinjiang's population. Many chafe at Chinese rule and a much smaller number seek independence, but human rights groups say that the authorities do not distinguish between terrorists, political separatists and people who simply seek greater autonomy.A report on Xinjiang TV said 476 people had sought treatment for syringe stabbings, though only 89 had obvious signs of being pricked, and that no deaths, infections or poisonings occurred. While Xinhua stressed that Uighurs and other ethnic groups were among the victims, the TV report said the vast majority ? 433 ? were Han Chinese.China has previously experienced unfounded rumours of Aids patients attacking people with hypodermic needles.Reuters said an angry Han crowd confronted anti-riot police stopping them from entering a Uighur neighbourhood this morning.""They have no right to block off the road like this. These Uighurs have been stabbing us with needles,"" one of the men said. ""We need to take care of the problem.""Hundreds of police then moved in to disperse the crowd, which scattered into nearby streets. Witnesses reported attacks on Uighurs during the protests yesterday.One resident told Associated Press that relations between Han Chinese and Uighurs were ""very bad"".He added: ""These people making trouble, we catch one, we kill one.""Zhou Yijun, a government office worker, added: ""People are angry at the government, they are scared. We are living under conditions that are not normal.""The unrest is particularly alarming to authorities as they prepare to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Communist party rule in China on October 1. They have said that social stability must be a top priority.It also reveals the seething ethnic grievances which remain in the city after the worst communal violence in the region for more than a decade. The rioting erupted on 5 July, with brutal attacks on mostly Han Chinese after an apparently peaceful Uighur protest against the killing of two Uighur men in southern China. Days later, Han vigilantes launched revenge attacks.Xinhua said late last night that 196 suspects had been charged over the July riot and 51 faced trials.But a Han shop owner told Reuters: ""I think the government has been way too lax towards the Uighurs.""We shouldn't have all these minorities, we should only have one Chinese ethnicity.""The exiled Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer, who denies Beijing's claims that she incited July's violence, claimed that yesterday's protest started after more than 500 rioters attacked Uighurs.""But in the afternoon, thousands of Chinese came out to protest against the crackdown by the provincial authorities and to demand unity with the Uighurs,"" Kadeer said. Neither aspect of her account was corroborated by witnesses.guardian.co.uk ?

Attached to the front of their garments wasthe slogan, ""Government must stress integrity"" [ jiang cheng xin ], and on the back, ""Nodiscrimination against ethnic minorities."" Several hundred riot policewere on the scene, but there were no bloody clashes. An official of the headoffice of the Nanjing city government confirmed for this Center that thedemonstration did take place. An official surnamed Yang at Nanjing's Bureau ofNationalities and Religions also confirmed the demonstration. The demonstrationlasted for five hours, and then broke up peacefully. Yesterday the ""entire body of believers in Islam inWenzhou"" issued an open letter calling on the government to return theproperty of a mosque. The open letter indicated that the building at 55Jiaoxiang Lane used to be a mosque, but it has been occupied [ zhan yong ; original letter reads ba zhan , occupied by force] by others,leaving the Islamic faithful nowhere to conduct their religious activities. Theletter also said Wenzhou has no Islamic clergy. The letter noted that recentlynetizens have been expressing implacable hatred toward the petty thieves in Xinjiang,but if there were a religious venue such as a mosque, and clergy, they couldplay a very good role in persuading this particular group. For that reason,they call on the city government to approve the restoration of the mosque asquickly as possible. (The text of the Wenzhou open letter appears on ourwebsite.)

On Friday, large parts of the city were shut down to make way for tanks and rocket launchers rumbling through the streets, and yesterday saw squadrons of jets and helicopters shooting through the skies trailing smoke as part of rehearsals for the event.The 60th anniversary is a politically fraught time, during which nothing can be left to chance, as it is the Communist Party?s main platform for its achievements over 60 years. Activists and petitioners are being rounded up, just as they were before the Olympics last year and are before the meeting of the annual parliament, the National People?s Congress.On Thursday last week, Mr Ding became involved in an argument with some street vendors after his car caused some damage to a stall. He was surrounded by the stall-holders and things came to blows. Mr Ding went to the school after the incident, then told the police about what had happened afterwards. The following Saturday he was arrested.?We students have not heard from him since then. So on September 12th, over 100 students went to the police bureau in Haidian District to protest. Some of our students were taken into the police station and were beaten,? said Mr Yu. ?Ding Xiaoping is a good teacher. He is very responsible, very concerned about young people,? he added.Another of Mr Ding?s graduates, surnamed Liu, said that this should have been a simple civil dispute, but instead the teacher was being kept incommunicado.?Since our teacher was detained, they do not allow us to meet or talk to him. On Sunday, our teacher called one of our students, and said he had been beaten by officials of the Public Security Bureau. Since then we have not heard anything from him. We can only wait to see what will happen next,? she said.",NA,Beijing,Beijing district police station western Haidian district,14,100,

Within hours, some of the thousands in the city of Tieling who have been worshipping the wrong remains took to the streets in fury.Nearly 1,000 protesters descended on the local government headquarters, and people in the crowd gave the crematorium's director such a beating he needed hospital treatment. At least one man was detained after the crowd clashed with hundreds of riot police on Wednesday, said one protester, who would not give his name.A spokesman for the district civil affairs bureau tried to heap the blame on the junior crematorium employee and said only one family had received the wrong ashes, and then only by mistake. But yesterday, authorities in Tieling, and some of the families affected, contradicted this account, saying as many as 2,800 families had been givenen given the wrong remains.The scandal at the Qinghe district funeral home in the city in Liaoning province came to light when the family of 82-year-old Li Eshan became suspicious after receiving cold ashes after his funeral on Sunday, the Southern Metropolis News reported. Relatives were shocked when they discovered his corpse in another room - and the two baskets of ashes.The family confronted the young crematorium worker and beat him after he confessed that he had been ""taught by senior staff"" to give strangers' ashes to families to save time. The family learned that since the young employee had started working there in 2007, most families had received substitute ashes.More than 2,800 families who had had loved ones cremated there since 2007 had registered with the local government for compensation, the Southern Metropolis News reported.The bureau spokesman would not say whether they were eligible for compensation. He said the young worker had been detained and police were investigating.One of those affected said: ""It's a nightmare to know that what's inside the tiny box isn't my parent but a stranger's ashes. I... don't know where my parent's remains are.""Another, addressing his comments to the funeral home staff, said: ""How can you do this? Would you treat your own father t he same way?""

They are now being investigated,"" he said.He added that several police officers were hurt in the standoff, while damage was also done to public property.The incident came after more than 200 traders objected to a government order to close Luoshiwan Market and complained they had not received adequate compensation, Yao said.According to initial investigations, he said the protest had been ""planned"".More than 200 merchants from Luoshiwan Market and the Yunfang Business Zone marched on the headquarters of the provincial people's congress on Friday to deliver a 330-signature petition to the arbitration office, he said. Later that day, the organizers planned Saturday's protest at a toy mall in Yunfang.Luoshiwan is known as one of the top 10 wholesale markets in China, boasting units for more than 10,000 traders. Local authorities reportedly have plans to close the market this month and relocate businesses to an area about 10 km away.The move is aimed at promoting urban function, Kunming authorities said.""I applaud the government's move to relocate the market as it always affects traffic in the area,"" a Kunming resident, surnamed Li, told China Daily yesterday.However, Luoshiwan Market merchants say they have the right to ask for government compensation for the relocation.""The new market location is not ideal for business and I am afraid it will not be a good choice for merchants like us in the coming five years,"" said a merchant who refused to be named yesterday.Bao Wensheng, chief of the city's Xishan district business affairs bureau, said the government carried out events to encourage merchants to move before the Nov 30 deadline.""We have given every merchant who wants to relocate 300 yuan in compensation,"" China National Radio quoted him as saying yesterday.

Many cannot air their complaints in local media or courts, which are controlled by the Communist Party."

An Associated Press report said that about 400 protesters took part in the demonstration while several hundred police officers surrounded the crowd and roped off the streets in order to stop hundreds more from joining. The initial group of 200 people arrived at Guangzhou Management Committee office at about 9 am Monday, the monthly open house when officials receive visitors and hear their views on urban construction and administration. Since so many were unable to meet with the officials, they walked to a nearby government office building. Some wore masks and carried signs that said, ""No trash incineration and preserve green Guangzhou."" They left at about 3 pm. ""We hoped the officials could talk to all of us, but they insisted we send five representatives to negotiate with them,"" a Panyu resident surnamed L?told the Global Times Monday in a telephone interview. He said protestors refused to ""be represented,"" and demanded the resignation of L?Zhiyi, former director of City Appearance, Environment and Sanitation Bureau, due to his ""notorious record."" L? now the deputy secretary general of the Guangzhou government, told reporters Sunday he supports the project and that the plan was ""unshakable."" Some villagers from Panyu told reporters that they were blocked from joining the demonstration. Wen Yunchao, a popular blogger based in Guangzhou, told the Global Times that the protest was unorganized but was generally peaceful. ""Since we didn't agree to have representatives selected among us, the protest ended without a solution,"" he said. ""But it's a good start for people to take serious action and express themselves without feeling frightened,"" he added. Some residents put the number at between 1,500 and 2,000, but police did not confirm the figures. Many residents succeeded in their bid to have a meeting with the officials. Zhang Jianguo, deputy director of Guangzhou city management committee, said he told the residents at the meeting that the incinerator issue could be discussed and people who oppose it could pose questions, according to dayoo. com, a news website hosted by Guangzhou Daily.

Xinhua reported that the municipality's party boss, Zhang Gaoli, who is a member of the Communist Party's politburo, and Mayor Huang Xingguo visited the victims' families.Many mainland cities, including Beijing, limit battery-powered and petrol motorbikes and tricycles. Jinghai county said tricycle drivers did not have licences or insurance, and were a hazard to car drivers.The county government started a campaign to crack down on tricycles in July. Many drivers complained their livelihoods were affected.Last month, the county banned tricycles on most roads between 7am and 10pm. In October, law enforcers vowed to seize all rental tricycles and imposed fines of up to 30,000 yuan (HK$34,000) on drivers.Farmers from the county believed the two notices incensed pedicab drivers who did not have any other way to make a living.""Most drivers are st ruggling laid-off workers who don't get any financial aincial aid from the government,"" said a witness who declined to be named. ""The hire fees, sometimes only two or three yuan, are the main income for the whole family. Protesters complained that county cadres were totally unconcerned about the plight of the laid-off workers.""The witness believed the cheap tricycles had shrunk the profits of taxi companies, which was the main reason for the clampdown.Mainland media have widely reported that taxi operators have colluded with local governments to eliminate cheap services offered by motorbikes and tricycle drivers.Official figures show that more than 10 million migrant workers lost their jobs across the nation during the global economic downturn.The central government has warned of resulting social unrest, but suicide protests are rare.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English -- Website of well-respected non-PRC-owned daily newspaper and Hong Kong's most prominent English-language daily; features extensive original reporting on Hong Kong and PRC political issues and an even-handed editorial line; URL: http://www.scmp.com]",Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English,Tianjin,Beijing-Shanghai railway line,4,100,http://www.rfa.org/cantonese/news/China_protest-12292009094749.html

""But there were too many police, they even deployed riot police. We couldn't do anything,"" said Cai whose four-year-old son was abducted in Shenzhen in 2008.In recent years, an expanding network of parents and volunteers has surfaced across China to try and locate the thousands of children that go missing each year.Many have been dismayed by the indifferent attitude of law enforcers, and low breakthrough rates, even in cases like Cai's where the kidnappers were recorded clearly on CCTV cameras.Some of the children were snatched from elite schools in Shenzhen by criminals, prompting nervous parents to step up security measures. The South China Morning Post cited a Shenzhen government official as saying there were 23 child kidnappings last year, of which three children were killed.In grittier factory towns in southern China like Dongguan, children of poorer blue-collar families are frequently kidnapped and sold on blackmarkets to meet demand for predominantly male heirs in a country still largely bound by the one-child policy.China's Ministry of Public Security reported 2,566 potential child trafficking cases in 2008, but other groups say the actual numbers run in the tens of thousands.(Reporting by James Pomfret; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani)",Reuters,Guangdong,Shenzhen ,14,20,missing children

1389,4/9/10,Citizen (China),Police (China),Demonstrate or rally,NA,8080324,Growing urban unrest rattles authorities,"City-dwellers take to the streets to protest against thuggish law-enforcement officersALTERCATIONS between unlicensed street vendors and law-enforcement officers are commonplace in China. Sometimes they escalate into scuffles or riots. But a night-time rampage by hundreds of citizens in the southern city of Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, on March 26-27 has aroused fresh concerns about a malaise in Chinese cities.The violence in Kunming reportedly left dozens injured. Ten government vehicles were overturned and some set on fire by crowds enraged by rumours that a vendor had been killed by an officer of Kunming's ``City Administration and Law Enforcement Bureau''. This agency, commonly known by its Chinese abbreviation Chengguan, is a junior cousin to the police force. It is responsible for matters such as clearing the streets of illegal pedlars and supervising house demolitions. Chengguan officers are renowned for their thuggish, fine-gouging ways.The vendor, as it turned out, had not been killed. But the rioters could be forgiven for assuming the worst. In the past couple of years even some state-controlled newspapers have made common cause with critics of Chengguan activities across the country. In January 2008 a man in the central province of Hubei was beaten to death when he attempted to film officers trying to stop a protest by villagers against a dump for urban waste. ``Another citizen has fallen. When will we stand up and restrain the Chengguan system?'' wrote a newspaper columnist at the time.The Chinese press has reported others having fallen to the Chengguan since: a pedlar left severely brain-damaged after a mauling in Shanghai last July; a man beaten to death in Beijing in October after being accused of illegally using his motorcycle as a taxi. One case prompted a letter to China's legislature. A woman in the province of Sichuan died last November after setting herself on fire in protest when officers burst into her home to enforce a demolition order. In response, a group of Beijing law professors wrote proposing tighter controls on demolition procedures.Protests triggered by Chengguan brutality have rattled the authorities, hypersensitive as they are to any urban unrest that might turn against the government. Last May hundreds of university students protested in the eastern city of Nanjing against the alleged beating of a classmate.The following month police rescued several Chengguan who were captured by rioters in a town in the southern province of Guangdong. In Kunming last October protesters put the corpse of a pedicab-driver, who had allegedly been killed by Chengguan, on a gurney and wheeled it to a Chengguan office where they burned paper as a traditional funeral offering (the authorities said he had died naturally).The latest flare-up in Kunming has also attracted considerable press attention. One newspaper website described the eruption as symptomatic of public resentment against local officialdom that could blow up like ``a bomb at any time''. Another newspaper attacked the Kunming authorities for releasing only bare details. A third suggested the official version of events, that the vendor had simply fallen over, might be a ``lie'' (a word even used in the headline). It quoted witnesses saying an officer had pushed over her pedicab, pinning the woman under it. A gas canister had then rolled on top of her, knocking her unconscious.In recent weeks, a speech on social unrest by a prominent Chinese scholar, Yu Jianrong, has been widely circulated on the internet in China. In it Mr Yu describes the emergence in recent years of a new type of social unrest, which he calls ``venting incidents'': brief, unorganised outbursts of public rage against the authorities or the wealthy. China's efforts to enforce ``rigid stability'', he argues, were not sustainable and could result in ``massive social catastrophe''. Even government officials, he notes, are giving warning in private of worse to come.- The Economist Newspaper Ltd,London, 2010",The Economist Newspaper Ltd,Yunnan,Kunming,3,100,"Brutal police: City-dwellers take to the streets to protest against thuggish law-enforcement officershttp://www.360doc.com/content/10/0329/10/79542_20698261.shtml"

1398,5/1/10,Citizen (China),Healthcare Facility (China),Demonstrate or rally,Jiangsu Sheng,13219246,Chinese city urges citizens to 'trust the government' following protest over school attack,"TAIXING, China (AP) - A Chinese city shaken by one of three back-to-back attacks on schools stepped up security and urged its citizens to ""trust the government"" Saturday, a day after parents of the injured children protested outside a local hospital.A dozen police and security guards patrolled the lobby of the Taixing city People's Hospital the morning after marching parents chanted ""We want the truth,"" asked to see their children and demanded a better government response to the crisis. Photos and video posted online showed hundreds of people massed outside the hospital Friday night, pushing so hard to get in that they shattered a glass door.The school attack in Taixing came Thursday when a 47-year-old unemployed man armed with an 8-inch (20-centimeter) knife wounded 29 students aged 4 or 5 -- five of them seriously -- plus two teachers and a security guard.The city government tried to ease fears in a mobile phone text message sent to citizens Saturday.""No one has died, and all of the parents have seen their injured children,"" the government said.""Citizens please trust the government, don't believe rumors,"" the text said.A parent of one of the four children still in intensive care confirmed that he and other parents had been able to see their children Friday and Saturday. Xin Feng, the father of a 4-year-old boy, said parents had no plans for further protests.Xin had said a government employee was handing out compensation to families Saturday, but later said he had been mistaken and that the money was from a private citizen.""We don't want the government money. We just want the children to be OK,"" he said, adding that parents also want a reasonable explanation from the government of the attack.""When I walked into the ICU this morning, my son recognized me but couldn't talk,"" Xin said. ""He looked so helpless.""The anger and fear come after three classroom assaults in three days across China. The government issued an urgent order Friday for schools to tighten security, and armed police will patrol schools in the capital, Beijing, when classes resume Tuesday after the May Day holiday.The attack in Taixing came a day after a 33-year-old former teacher broke into a primary school in the southern city of Leizhou and wounded 15 students and a teacher with a knife. The attacker had been on sick leave from another school since 2006 for mental health problems.And on Friday, a farmer used a motorcycle to break down the gate of a primary school in the eastern city of Weifang and struck five students with a hammer. He then poured gasoline over his body and burned to death, Xinhua said.Chinese schools have had five such attacks in just over a month -- unusual in a country where extreme violence is comparatively rare and strict controls keep most people from owning guns. Sociologists suspect the rampages -- usually by lone, male attackers -- could be copycat actions.State media reports have largely shied away from why students have been targets. Experts say outbursts against defenseless children can be due to social pressures in a rapidly changing society.The attacks have been particularly shocking because most urban families in China have only one child due to government population control policies.""There are a few children whose medical condition is still very critical,"" said Li Wenjiang, the director at the Taixing city People's Hospital. ""There are two children with broken windpipes who suffered from lack of oxygen and lack of blood, so their condition is quite critical. Another also has puncture wounds in his chest.""Nearby, two of the injured girls were seen in beds quietly clutching stuffed animals. Their heads had been stitched up.The Ministry of Public Security on Saturday ordered police across the country to strengthen patrols in and around schools at the beginning and end of the school day and to inspect small hotels, Internet cafes and ""recreational sites"" next to schools, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. Schools were urged to install surveillance cameras and security alarms.The education vice minister, Hao Ping, said emergency management is a ""heavy task"" with 270 million students across China, according to a Xinhua report Saturday. Hao said the government was setting up a 22-member expert team to focus on ""public incidents"" in the education system.The central government first ordered increased school security in 2004 following an attack that left nine students dead at a Beijing school.

1400,5/19/10,Protester (China),Police (China),Demonstrate or rally,Tibet,19899958,SCMP: Tibetans Beaten During Angry Protests,"Residents from more than 11 villages in Madang township, Labrang gathered outside the Amdo Cement factory on Saturday morning, demanding tougher pollution controls, according to a villager and accounts by a Tibet advocacy group.The villager, who is a Han Chinese and refused to give her name, said armed police and regular police were soon called in to control the crowd. She said four protest organisers were arrested.""The Tibetans were very angry, they were not happy that the factory has produced pollution,"" she said.The International Campaign for Tibet said the Tibetans gathered outside the factory in an attempt to submit a petition letter to the authorities.It said 15 protesters were taken to hospital with gunshot wounds after police fired at the villagers.Whether there was shooting could not be independently verified and the authorities in Madang could not be reached for comment.Photographs taken by villagers showed several protesters with injuries apparently caused by the police. But the injuries were not gunshot wounds. Photos also showed police armed with shields and batons sealing off the entrance to the cement factory.According to a copy of the petition letter obtained by the South China Morning Post (SEHK: 0583 , announcements , news ) , the villagers demanded tougher control of the dust emitted by the factory. They also asked the factory to withdraw from a religious site and an old road that it had forcibly occupied.Once a state-owned enterprise, the cement factory, built in 1985, was privatised in 1998. It has since become one of Gansu's major cement makers.Villagers complained that after the factory increased production last year, they had found it difficult to open their eyes because of the tremendous amount of dust it spewed.""For those who live near the cement factory, our agricultural yields have dropped significantly, by more than 60 per cent, because of the huge amount of dust emitted by the factory,"" the letter said.Villagers added that their grassland had been turned grey, with the grass growing much slower than before.""The cows and sheep no longer eat the grass growing on contaminated slopes, forcing us to buy pasturage somewhere else. Our natural pasture has lost its function to feed the livestock. This has significantly affected our life,"" the letter said.The villagers said they were left to petition government departments after talks with factory management failed to achieve anything.The central government has stepped up security in Tibetan-populated areas since the deadly protests in 2008, especially during the anniversary of those protests each March.The tight security measures appear to have clamped down on public demonstrations, although sporadic small-scale protests have still broken out during the anniversaries.About 20 Tibetan school students took to the streets in Machu, Gansu, on March 14 this year, the second anniversary of the rioting, reportedly calling for Tibet's independence.Last weekend's protest would have been the largest in a Tibetan-populated area since 2008, but for a very different cause.Environmental degradation has become a huge source of social tension across the mainland. Serious environmental problems stemming from three decades of breakneck economic growth have prompted demonstrations and even riots. Environmental experts have expressed concern at excessive mining and economic development on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, where the ecological system is fragile.Wang Yongchen, a Beijing-based environmentalist, said the government should reconsider the development pattern on the plateau because it was not sustainable.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English -- Website of well-respected non-PRC-owned daily newspaper and Hong Kong's most prominent English-language daily; features extensive original reporting on Hong Kong and PRC political issues and an even-handed editorial line; URL: http://www.scmp.com]",Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English,Gansu,"Labrang, Madang township",5,300,http://www.rfa.org/cantonese/news/tibetan_protest-05182010113848.html/story_main?encoding=traditional

The four counties, near the border of Yushu, are under the jurisdiction of Sichuan.He declined to be named for fear of political reprisal.The Tibetan protesters began gathering outside the government office at 2pm and blocked a main road. They agreed to disperse two hours later after officials promised to give them aid.There were no clashes.The director of Yushu's civil affairs bureau held a meeting with four representatives of the demonstrators and agreed to give them the same subsidies as local residents.""If they don't keep their promise, we will take to the streets again,"" the protester said.He said they were asking the government to provide the 4,250 migrants from the four counties the same aid entitlement as other Yushu permanent residents because they were also victims of the earthquake.More than 180 relatives of the demonstrators died in the quake, he said.""We are not considered quake victims even though our houses in Yushu were destroyed,"" he said. ""That means we are not entitled to living and relocation subsidies.""Under the compensation scheme, families who lost members in the quake are entitled to 8,000 yuan (HK$9,145) each. Every Yushu resident is also allowed to claim 10 yuan daily and a one-off relocation subsidy of 150 yuan.Beijing earmarked 200 million yuan for emergency relief after the quake. It also pledged to set aside 9 billion yuan in reconstruction funds for Yushu this year.A Han shopowner from Sichuan said Han migrants also received little assistance from the government.""I have not received even a bottle of water or a packet of instant noodles since the quake,"" he said.Han migrants were not involved in yesterday's demonstration.The shopowner said many migrants were also upset about the unfair distribution of relief material. ""I heard that someone who has connections with local officials got up to seven or eight emergency tents, but victims, like me, who came from elsewhere got nothing.""The government in Yushu turned a deaf ear to us. They just ignore our complaints about unfair distribution of relief resources.""At least 2,200 people died and more than 100,000 were left homeless after the 7.1-magnitude earthquake.Xinhua yesterday reported that the Civil Affairs Ministry had received donations totalling 5.51 billion yuan in cash and kind.",Xinhua News,Qinghai,Yushu,3,200,"About 200 Tibetan migrants living in quake-hit Yushu , Qinghai , protested outside the local government office yesterday to demand the distribution of relief aid set aside for quake victims.However, the two-hour protest ended peacefully after a government official agreed to their demand."

""I went to the district courthouse yesterday (Tuesday), as soon as I heard about the shootings, some time after 4pm,"" Qing Zhao , a petitioner, said yesterday. ""Even then I saw another petitioner there.""When Qing went to the court again yesterday morning, he saw a middle-aged woman holding a placard and voicing her discontent outside the complex despite heavy rain.Qing said he was beaten in 2003 by gangsters he suspected had been sent by the principal of the school where he worked as a teacher -possibly a revenge attack after he tried to denounce his boss for taking bribes.Qing lost vision in one of his eyes as a result of the attack and was in a coma for nearly a month. Medical treatment cost him more than 40,000 yuan (HK$45,600).""I gave up any hope of petitioning to get justice because I came to realise that it's impossible to rely on officials to solve our problems, so it was worthless and meaningless to petition them for that reason,"" Qing said. ""I went to the courthouse for no other reason than to have a look at the other petitioners.""According to the China News Service, Zhu, the attacker, was disappointed with the local court's handling of his divorce from his wife -particularly the division of property.But the judges he shot had nothing to do with the case, the report said.Zhu had reportedly taken two months of leave to rest at home. He did not return to work until Saturday, three days before the killings.Source: South China Morning Post website, Hong Kong, in English 3 Jun 10",South China Morning Post,Hunan,Yongzhou,14,20,

It employs 1,400 workers and supplies Honda vehicle assembly plants with locks and key sets.The lock factory had earlier agreed to increase each employee's monthly salary by 100 yuan and to raise the standard of over-time pay to 50 yuan per day, but the offer was short of the striking workers' demand for about a 500 yuan increase per month.This was the third strike to hit Honda's suppliers in Guangdong in less than a month.

The protesters from Pangling village marched toward the county government building, shouting slogans and holding banners that read, ""Return my home, Return my river,"" but were blocked from the building entrance by armed police and government officials. ""All villagers returned home Wednesday and we are trying to resolve the conflict after communi-cating with them in order to maintain social stability,"" the head of the Jingxi county government Information Office, surnamed Chen, told the Global Times Wednesday without giving additional details on the clash between protesters and police. The incident was resolved Tuesday without casualties and traffic is flowing freely in the county, she added. The protest was directly triggered by a conflict between villagers and Xinfa aluminum factory executives on July 11. The Shandong Xinfa Group has invested heavily in the factory, a major pro-ducer of aluminum chloride in Guangxi. Villagers claimed that the Xinfa factory has endangered their health and living environment by polluting the local river, the main source of their drinking water. The villagers said the river turned red after the aluminum factory began operations in 2007 without taking environmental protection measures. Their complaints have circulated on the Internet, with several entries and photos posted on baidu's online forum. The information official refuted the accusations, insisting that the factory is safe. Xinfa refused to comment on the protest. Constant disputes between the villagers and factory officials turned violent on July 11, when the villagers tried to stop the factory from building a new transportation lane to replace an older road, washed out by flashfloods during a recent earthquake. The villagers said the road construction was undertaken without government approval. According to the government, some villagers destroyed factory equipment during the July 11 violence. The protesters said some people were beaten and injured by factory workers and that several elderly people were pushed into the river.

[as published, in English] (0935 hours, 27 Jul 2010) --- This Center has learned that major and bloody clashes have erupted in Shucheng County, Anhui, when 2,000 people protesting pollution of a river clashed with hundreds of Public Security personnel. One hundred people have been injured between 24 July and today at the government building and other locations, as 2,000 members of the public protested pollution caused by the construction upstream of a large garbage processing plant. As of early this morning, authorities have brought in to Shucheng as many as a thousand Armed Police and Public Security riot control personnel from other locations. A netizen photographed several hundred Public Security personnel attacking and beating a crowd of demonstrators. As many as a hundred members of the public have been injured so far. Two people were taken to a hospital in critical condition. This Center has learned that the county government is redeveloping the former ordnance industry 608 Factory on the upper reaches of the Nangang River in that county, to set up a large garbage processing plant. This will seriously pollute the drinking water of tens of thousands of villagers within the jurisdiction of Nangang and other towns. On 24 July, several hundred members of the public blocked National Route 206 to protest. As a result, they were beaten by hundreds of riot control police personnel, during which one elderly person and one woman were seriously injured. Because a rumor spread that the seriously injured people had died, on 25 and 26 July more than 2,000 villagers and other residents of Shucheng County went to the government building to demonstrate. Yesterday and the day before, the authorities urgently brought in Armed Police, special police, and Public Security personnel to Shucheng County from places including Liuan. The numbers of riot control Public Security and Armed Police personnel have now reached as many as a thousand. Three major and bloody clashes between crowds of demonstrators and Public Security personnel occurred on 25 and 26 July. The crowd carried many long banners, including one berating county governor Zhao Qiang as being a fascist, and Public Security personnel would sometimes clash with villagers when grabbing the banners. Six journalists from three media organizations including Anhui Television had their photographic equipment seized, and two people from Anhui TV were injured. This morning a large number of residents are still gathered in front of county government headquarters, and several hundred Public Security personnel are on guard. From 24 July to today, as many as a hundred members of the public have been injured in the demonstrations, and two people have been taken to a hospital in critical condition.

1421,8/2/10,Protester (China),Police (China),Demonstrate or rally,Beijing Shi,13290221,Pro-Cantonese protesters scuffle with China police,"BEIJING, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Hundreds in China's southern export hub of Guangdong scuffled with police at a weekend protest to support the local Cantonese dialect, a witness said, with a small group of reporters and protesters briefly detained by police.The second rally in as many weeks -- sparked by a proposal to switch much programming on local television to mainstream Mandarin Chinese -- had kicked off largely peacefully on Sunday afternoon in Guangzhou until several hundred police officers showed up and tried to break up proceedings, triggering scuffles.About two dozen people were taken away by police and detained, including eight Hong Kong journalists, said one reporter at the scene who was held and questioned for several hours before being released.Officials detained the organiser of a similar protest last week for several days and threatened to punish anyone who organised new demonstrations.Guangzhou police posted a statement on the department's website accusing the protesters of holding illegal gatherings, saying they would ""punish those who were unreasonable and created trouble,"" the South China Morning Post reported.Observers said the sensitivity of Guangzhou authorities to such public protests may be linked to the city's hosting of the Asian Games in November, one of Asia's largest sporting events, which has also led to a tightening of immigration policies for the city's large community of African and Middle Eastern traders.Stability-obsessed Communist Party officials in Beijing tend, however, to be wary of any public demonstrations that challenge official policy, however minor the issue might appear to be.In neighbouring Hong Kong, around one hundred people held a rally on Sunday and marched to the city's government headquarters to show support for the mainland protests.Beijing has promoted Mandarin Chinese, the country's official language, for decades to unite a nation with thousands of dialects and numerous minority languages.But Cantonese is still widely spoken in large swathes of southern China including Hong Kong, Macau and the booming province of Guangdong, with people there fiercely proud of their unique linguistic culture and identity, thanks in part to the spill-over influence of Hong Kong's wildly successful and racy vernacular ""Cantopop"" culture.Local Guangzhou television stations were given the go-ahead to start broadcasting in Cantonese in the 1980s in a bid to lure viewers away from cross-border shows.The plans to shift TV shows back out of Cantonese fed fears the government wants to phase it out in official settings.An influx of outsiders seeking work in China's coastal export hubs has bolstered the case for more Mandarin both on television and in daily life, its supporters say.

Police arrested several protesters for unlawful assembly Sunday afternoon in the city of Guangzhou's People's Park, where they were rallying for the preservation of Cantonese, the city government said in a statement.An estimated 1,000 activists gathered in the park for the second Sunday of protests in a row.The demonstrations also spilled over to Hong Kong, despite government efforts last week to dispel concerns sparked when TV stations were asked to switch prime-time shows to Mandarin."

But internet posts by residents spread the story and pictures of the incident until they were blocked.The case follows other incidents across the mainland that are increasingly being caused by people's discontent over violent law enforcement and perceived inequity in the justice system.The internet posts, accompanied by photos showing a large crowd protesting in front of a police station, claimed at least several residents were beaten bloody by policemen. The photos showed thousands of residents blocking the main road of the town in front of the police station and surrounding the building. Web posts said some protesters threw bricks and stones, several police vehicles were damaged and rolled over, police were besieged inside the building and several policemen were injured.An employee at the Kedou Internet Cafe, next to the police station, confirmed yesterday that the riot occurred but refused to offer further details. ""I don't want to say anything more,"" she said by phone. ""I don't want to be jailed. Go and ask the government.""No one inside the police station would comment.The web posts said the crowd gathered around 3pm and tried to storm the police station after hearing two residents were beaten by policemen. A woman was beaten bloody by urban management officers after she had refused to move her motorbike in front of a store.A man with a bloody hand also rushed out of a local hospital and down the street, shouting he had been beaten by police over a dispute between him and the hospital. More angry residents accompanied the man to the police station.No official has confirmed the reason for the protests.On July 5, thousands clashed with hundreds of police and government officials while trying to storm the Gangkou town government building in Jiangxi .

Holding placards, including one reading, ""Burn you Japan!"" three young Chinese arrived at about 9 a.m. in front of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, where more than 20 vehicles of the Chinese public security authorities were deployed. Shortly thereafter, about 50 demonstrators gathered and shouted, ""Return the captain [of the fishing boat]"" and ""Boycott Japanese products!"" Some of the protesters stamped on a handmade Japanese flag. About 100 people then marched in a demonstration. The march was broken up by the Chinese security authorities at about noon. Near the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, about 30 protesters held a banner reading, ""The Diaoyu Islands belong to the Chinese people!"" The Senkaku Islands are called the Diaoyu Islands in China. The Chinese authorities ushered away the demonstrators after about two hours, and took into custody several people believed to be central figures in the protest.

1435,9/27/10,Citizen (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Beijing Shi,19228625,Caixin Wang: Ping An Bank Minority Shareholders Stage Sit-In,"(Beijing) - Dozens of minority shareholders of Ping An Bank staged a sit-in in front of the Shenzhen headquarters of the lender on September 25 after their requests to revalue shares and convene a shareholder meeting were rejected.On September 21, the Shenzhen-based lender rejected their request on the grounds that their combined stake was not more than 10 percent, falling short of the requirement to initiate a meeting.Minority shareholders are questioning the validity of the fall of their stake below the 10 percent mark in a few years. Ping An Bank spokesman Sheng Ruisheng said that the Ping An Insurance Group took over shares from some stakeholders and bought shares in a rights issue in 2009, boosting its stake to over 90 percent. Sheng said the process was legal.Rejecting the request by minority shareholders to set the share price at six to 12 yuan, Sheng said if minority shareholders do not like the proposed valuation, they can resort to a lawsuit.The valuation of the Ping An Bank has been an issue since early September when China's second largest insurer, Ping An Insurance Group, decided to inject the assets of Ping An Bank, in which it has about 90 percent stake, into the Shenzhen Development Bank. The insurer's stake in SDB will rise from the currently nearly 30 percent to over 50 percent after the injection.[Description of Source: Beijing Caixin Wang in English ?

1454,12/3/10,Citizen (China),Government (China),Demonstrate or rally,Shanghai Shi,13385982,Hundreds mourn victimof 'murder' by hired thugs,"Hundreds of Shanghai citizens gathered on Wednesday to mourn a man who was allegedly beaten to death by a demolition firm's hired thugs.Though smaller compared with the tens of thousands of people who took to the streets to pay respects to the dead after a fire in the city last month, the gathering still touched a nerve with police, who kept the crowd in close check and barred them from the mourning hall.Dozens of mourners defied the government's control measures and gathered outside the hall again yesterday, saying they were outraged by the violence.A wall outside the victim's home and the temporarily built mourning hall had been emblazoned with the words ""Private assets can't be infringed"" and ""The demolition company is the murderer"".The 49-year-old victim - Zhou Daming, a former security guard at a state-owned steel factory - was attacked by dozens of people who claimed to work for a demolition company during a squabble on Tuesday, according to his daughter, who declined to give her name.""About 20 of them said they were coming to distribute a forced eviction notice to each household. But is it necessary to assign so many people to send a notice? They definitely had other intentions,"" the woman told the South China Morning Post.At the time, only Zhou and his sister were at home. The quarrel started when Zhou questioned the visitors' identities.""They took away my aunt, and all of them beat up my father until he was in a coma. Then my aunt called emergency services, and meanwhile the assailants escaped,"" the daughter said.""They are so inhumane. The emergency health care workers arrived half an hour later and said my father was dead.""The plan was to develop the block where Zhou's home is located into a high-rise residential project by the Shanghai Dongya Property Holding Company, which is owned by the Huangpu district government, according to the 21st Century Business Herald. Dongya could not be reached for comment yesterday.Mourners outside Zhou's home yesterday said they were furious.""Violent demolition is so rampant in Shanghai and around China. It's unfair and unreasonable [for the developers and the demolition company] to bully us masses of ordinary people,"" said one woman in her 50s.Another onlooker, a man in his 60s, said: ""My home may be demolished, and I think each forced eviction is relevant to every one of us. I come to echo my support for the victim's family.""Zhou's daughter said on Wednesday that many wreaths had been placed around her home and put on the road outside. The police ordered nearby wreath sellers to suspend their sales.Warren Wang, a white-collar worker in Shanghai, visited the site on Tuesday evening, hours after reading a post on Twitter. He estimated there were 200 people in the demonstration on Wednesday.Wang said that on November 20 - the day before the mass mourning for the 58 people who died in the fire on November 15 - he sent messages to many of his friends urging them to visit the charred building.He later received a call from local police advising him that it was ""better not to go"".",South China Morning Post,Shanghai,,2,100,"force relocation: A wall outside the victim's home and the temporarily built mourning hall had been emblazoned with the words ""Private assets can't be infringed"" and ""The demolition company is the murderer""."
1456,12/3/10,Citizen (China),Government Religious (China),Demonstrate or rally,Jiangsu Sheng,20454487,SCMP: 'Catholic Seminarians Mount Rare Protest',"The show of defiance raised eyebrows, as the seminary is operated by the government-backed church.It added to the mounting tension before a key national congress in Beijing on Tuesday, when the mainland church will select its new leaders.The Vatican opposes the congress, saying it breaches Catholic doctrine about bishops' autonomy.Sino-Vatican relations were already strained after Beijing's unilateral ordination of a bishop in Hebei last month.Brandishing slogans and wearing their white uniforms, about 100 seminarians studying for the priesthood at the Catholic Theological and Philosophical Seminary of Hebei in Shijiazhuang staged a silent protest outside the offices of the Hebei Ethnic and Religious Affairs Bureau from early yesterday morning.They demanded that the government remove the seminary'eminary's newly appointed deputy rector.""We have no option but to stage this silent protest,"" said one seminarian who took part. ""We can stand the situation no longer.""Bureau officials said they were negotiating with the protesters but refused to give further details.Tang Zhaojun, a section chief at the bureau who is not a Catholic, was appointed by the government on November 11 to the seminary's leadership. He will take part in managing the religious institute and teach political education classes.The appointment sparked an uproar among the students, who have been on strike for two weeks with the support of their teachers, demanding that government officials not be appointed to head seminaries.Church insiders said the government had promised earlier to remove Tang in light of the strong protests by members of the seminary.But the possible resolution was thwarted after Beijing's ordination of Joseph Guo Jincai as bishop of the Chengde diocese last month.Some of the eight bishops who took part in what the Vatican called an ""illicit"" ordination ceremony are directors of the seminary. The rector is Joseph Ma Yinglin, who was ordained without papal approval as bishop of Kunming, Yunnan, in 2006. At two meetings with the seminarians yesterday, officials refused to remove Tang ""because the appointment was a (Communist) Party decision"", some of those present said.Anthony Lam Sui-ki, a senior researcher with Hong Kong's Holy Spirit Study Centre, said the rising discontent among Catholics against the government as demonstrated in the protest could deter bishops who are loyal to Rome from attending next week's national congress.Yesterday's open protest by Catholic seminarians against the authorities was the first since January 2000, when more than 150 seminarians at the National Seminary in Beijing refused to attend a ceremony in which five bishops were ordained by the government without papal approval.Many of those who took part in that boycott were dismissed from the seminary.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English -- Website of well-respected non-PRC-owned daily newspaper and Hong Kong's most prominent English-language daily; features extensive original reporting on Hong Kong and PRC political issues and an even-handed editorial line; URL: http://www.scmp.com]",Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English,Hebei,Shijiazhuang,6,100,"Brandishing slogans and wearing their white uniforms, about 100 seminarians studying for the priesthood at the Catholic Theological and Philosophical Seminary of Hebei in Shijiazhuang staged a silent protest outside the offices of the Hebei Ethnic and Religious Affairs Bureau from early yesterday morning.Tang Zhaojun, a section chief at the bureau who is not a Catholic, was appointed by the government on November 11 to the seminary's leadership.

1461,1/7/11,Citizen (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Anhui Sheng,20492543,SCMP: 'Protesting Parents Call For Answers on Poisoning',"Angry parents of children suffering from lead poisoning in Anhui province protested outside their local government headquarters yesterday, questioning the authorities' handling of a pollution scandal that has seen more than 200 children fall ill. Nearly 100 parents demonstrated in front of the county government office building yesterday and presented their demands to the county's Communist Party chief, Fan Xianhan , villagers in Gaohe, Huaining county said. They urged the county government to permanently shut down two battery factories blamed for causing leaks of the toxic metal, provide proper treatment for all the victims and compensate them for economic losses caused by the pollution scare. ""Although officials promise to look into the scandal, we doubt they are serious about tackling the pollution problems because they have always brushed off our concerns in the past,"" one demonstrator said. More than 200 children from the same neighbourhood in Gaohe have been found to have excessive concentrations of lead in their blood, ranging from 100 to 400 milligrams per litre, compared with normal levels of between zero and 100mg. Another 100 children living within 500 metres of the battery factories have yet to receive blood tests. The protest came a day after health authorities in the eastern province ordered 24 children awaiting treatment for lead poisoning at the provincial children's hospital to be discharged, saying they had normal concentrations of lead in their blood.""We've been told by county officials on Thursday that our children have been cured, but how could it be possible since they have yet to receive any treatment,"" said Huang Dazhai , father of a five-year-old boy.A hospital test on January 1 found that the lead concentration in his son's blood was 330.9mg per litre.A level over 200mg is considered hazardous and can impair children's mental health and affect growth. But both the hospital and county officials said the boy had a concentration of less than 50mg according to tests conducted by the provincial centre for disease control on Tuesday and Wednesday. Citing provincial health authorities, a statement posted on the county government website on Thursday also tried to play down the poisoning scare by saying no abnormal lead levels were found in blood tests of the children admitted to hospital. But the authorities refused to show official test results to the parents. Hua Shan, chief doctor at the hospital, told China Central Television it was normal for children to recover quickly from lead poisoning if they were kept away from the polluted environment and were given food therapy. But Huang was not convinced because his son still had headaches, chronic fatigue and a lack of appetite.Local authorities banned further testing for lead poisoning. ?

The monastery was surrounded by armed Chinese military officers.China's state-run Xinhua News Agency quoted an unnamed county government spokesman as confirming the immolation but saying that Phuntsog died ""on treatment delays."" No other casualties were reported.Source: Kyodo News Service, Tokyo, in English 0730 gmt 17 Mar 11","Kyodo News Service, Tokyo, in English",Sichuan,Aba,17,1000,"http://www.thetibetpost.com/zh/news/tibet/1533-a-monk-self-immolation-sparks-protest-in-tibet-hundreds-arrested                     Sichuan police have arrested ethnic Tibetan monks and protesters after more than 1,000 took to the streets on Wednesday to express anger over a young monk who died after setting himself on fire to protest against Chinese rule, the Tibetan government-in-exile and a rights group said yesterday.Xinhua confirmed the death of Phuntsog, who died early yesterday, more than 10 hours after setting himself alight on a street near the Kirti monastery the day before in Aba county, Sichuan, an area mainly populated by Tibetans.According to the government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India, more than 1,000 monks and other people shouted slogans and marched on the street for about a kilometre. Security forces dispersed them, using electric batons, it said.Police arrested monks and many protesters, the government-in-exile said, without specifying numbers. Security forces cordoned off the streets in and around the main market place in Aba, ordering people to stay at home.The government-in-exile said Phuntsog, who like many Tibetans uses only one name, set himself on fire to commemorate Tibetans ""killed in the Chinese government's brutal crackdown in the region {hellip} in 2008"".""It seems that the situation in Tibet is very desperate, for a monk to indulge in such an act,"" said Thubten Samphel, spokesman of the government-in-exile. ""The situation is very grim.""Many residents in the area declined to talk when contacted by a reporter who telephoned.The London-based International Campaign for Tibet quoted Kusho Tsering, a monk now living in Dharamsala, as saying hundreds of monks had marched to the main entrance of the Kirti monastery on Wednesday evening to demand the release of monks who had been arrested. Seven monks from Kirti were released later, but 20 were believed to be still in jail.Xinhua quoted a county government spokesman as blaming Phuntsog's death on delayed treatment. The report said police had rushed him to a nearby hospital, but monks from Kirti ""forcibly took Phuntsog out and hid him in the monastery"". He died soon after officials and his mother found him and sent him to the hospital, it said.Repeated calls to police and government offices in Aba went unanswered yesterday.Meanwhile, Tibet's parliament-in-exile was still deliberating about whether to approve the Dalai Lama's request to retire as political head of the government-in-exile, said Samphel.The parliament will decide whether to accept the Dalai Lama's resignation before next Friday."
1471,3/20/11,Citizen (China),Government (China),Demonstrate or rally,Jiangsu Sheng,19774073,HK Daily: Nanjing Residents Gather After Internet Call to Protest Axing of Trees,"Hundreds of residents in Jiangsu's Nanjing responded to an online call and went to?the Nanjing Library on?19 March to join a gathering to protect Oriental plane trees, and protest against the government's attempt to axe trees of historic significance in order to make way for the construction of a subway system in the city. Residents tied green ribbons around the trees and put up protest posters. Large numbers of public security officers arrived at the scene to be on guard. They cleared the area within an hour and took away five residents who had green ribbons around?their arms. According to sources, the Nanjing municipal government has determined the nature of the gathering --?which was manipulated by ""hostile forces from outside the border"" -- and prohibited local media from reporting on the event. In order to build the third route of the subway system, Nanjing has axed all the thick Oriental plane trees along both sides of?Taiping Avenue North and cut some of the branches. For the entire underground railway project, the authorities claim that 600 trees will have to be moved to some other places. Oriental plane boulevards and Chinese-Western architectural buildings from the Republic period have been the symbol of Nanjing. The city had 20,000 Oriental plane trees at the peak. Because of infrastructure building on a large scale in recent years the number has dropped to only 3,000, evoking strong indignation from the residents. Some of the Internet users even launched a drive via microblog to ""save Nanjing's Oriental plane trees and build a green wall,"" with more than 10,000 netizens claiming that they would join. Although the Nanjing municipal government announced that the plan to cut trees has been cancelled following the concern raised by high officials of the Kuomintang [KMT] on the other side of the Straits, netizens?decided to join the scheduled gathering. KMT Notes Cancellation of Decision to Axe Trees The gathering on 19 March took place at the square in front of the municipal library. Large numbers of public security officers were dispatched to the nearby areas on guard but they could not stop the residents from coming -- of which, most were students. At around 1500, hundreds of residents gathered in front of the square. The Internet users taking part in the gathering said: ""The police soon started to disperse people, who were herded to the platform. Later, they were herded to the square again and divided into groups. The attitude of most of the police was good but some of them tried to pull the residents and were knocked down. Some of the cameras were snatched."" In the microblog of Sina.com, a netizen who claimed to be a Nanjing public security officer called on residents attending the gathering to calmly and rationally stroll. He added, ""My heart is with you... We need to use equality and a rational and civilized voice and stance to strive for the right to speak, and eventually realize the rights and interests we have fought for."" Residents Dissatisfied at Axing of Oriental Plane Trees for Subway System There were no radical scenes?at the gathering. Some of the residents tied green ribbons on the trees nearby and put up posters which read: ""Keep the trees in Nanjing, no cutting, no moving, and no abandoning."" One of the ladies who had a green ribbon around her arm was pulled by several public security officers. The two sides pushed each other and eventually the lady was taken away by the police. Sources from the scene say that another four residents who had green ribbons on?their arms were also taken away. An hour later the crowd was dispersed by the police. Mr. Huang, who participated in the gathering, told Ming Pao that the number of people attending was affected by the drizzle in Nanjing yesterday. Although the government promised that no more trees will be axed, the gathering at least proved the power of the people. The city authorities have already determined the nature of the gathering, claiming that it was manipulated by ""hostile forces from outside the border,"" and prohibited the media from reporting on?the event. The message can only be transmitted verbally, and no written words or SMS are allowed.? Nanjing Mayor Reprimanded for Total Failure Nanjing's move to axe Oriental plane trees on a large scale to make way for the construction of the subway system has evoked protests from the residents. On the Internet, residents have also blamed Mayor Ji Jianye and questioned his governance. Since Ji Jianye assumed the office of mayor, a local official has said in private that none of his political achievement projects have been?flawless. The official added that Ji Jianye introduced political achievement and image projects on a large scale since he assumed the office of mayor in August 2009, in an attempt to contribute to the 60th anniversary of the PRC founding. After assuming office, he immediately allocated 380 million yuan to renovate the main roads, but the funds were not approved by the city's people's congress. The underground digging that cut a propylene pipeline on 28 July last year triggered a big explosion, shocking the whole city. More than 300 people were hurt, of whom 56 were seriously injured. In the construction of the underground railway, Nanjing's roads have been suffering from digging and then filling. The construction has caused heavy dust during daytime and noise at night. The axing of trees has irritated Nanjing residents and a local taxi driver said: ""It seems that Ji Jianye's feelings towards cement have far outstripped that towards the trees.""

1479,4/11/11,Citizen (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Yunnan Sheng,19664839,"HK Daily: Over 10,000 Jiangsu Villagers Protest Against Power Plant Construction","Jiangsu's Wuxi planned to build the nation's largest waste incineration power plant in Huangtutang village in Donggang township, which faced a protest by more than 10,000 villagers from the county. The villagers of Huangtutang even accused the village committee, which had obtained the signatures of around 80 percent of the villagers by promising that a Taigong temple would be built. Later, the committee stealthily altered the plan to one for the construction of a power plant and submitted it to the higher authorities. It was not until the completion of the first phase of the power plant project that the villagers found they had been deceived. Local residents numbering 10,000 at the peak have staged protests outside the Donggang government premises since last Thursday, voicing their objection to the construction and operation of the power plant. Reportedly, an old woman was beaten by village cadres last Saturday, which triggered indignation among the masses. The atmosphere was tense when the authorities dispatched large numbers of police officers to the scene. It is said that more than 2,000 villagers gathered yesterday and blocked the gate of the power plant. Bad Smell Released During Trial Operation Probably Polluted River and Land Reportedly, the township government decided in 2007 to build a power plant in Huangtutang village. In the name of building a Taigong temple, the village committee got the signatures of around 80 percent of the villagers. However, the signed agreement was stealthily altered to allow the construction of a power plant and submitted to the higher authorities. The project team immediately started the bidding process and conducted an environment assessment at the end of 2008. The power plant project started in 2009. As most of the villagers of Huangtutang are advanced in age and the village cadres promised that a temple would be built, the villagers never suspected fraud. It was not until the first phase of the power plant was completed at the end of last year and a strong, bad smell was released during the trial operation that the villagers realized that they had been deceived. Beginning this year, villagers from several villages within a radius of 5 kilometers of the power plant joined the protests. As the second phase of the power plant project will start soon, both the frequency and the scale of the mass protests have expanded. In mid-March, villagers of Huangtutang erected a wooden shed outside the power plant, interrupting the construction day and night. In early April, the authorities tried in vain to dispatch officers to negotiate with the villagers. The mass protest escalated, and the number of protesters totaled over 10,000 last Thursday. A villager said that most of the local residents are engaged in farming. Besides air pollution, they are worried that the waste water released by the power plant will pollute the river and land, impacting production of crops. Although the authorities have promised that five villages including Huangtutang and Pushi will be relocated when the power plant officially goes into operation, the villagers voiced their opposition, insisted on staying in their homes, and urged the authorities to shelve the power plant project. ?

They filled the entire street and blocked the road for hours,"" one nearby resident said yesterday.""People were getting very agitated by night-time. They set four police motorcycles alight, and a crowd managed to flip a police car over onto its roof.""They tried to turn over a police mini-van, but there were officers inside, so they had to give up.""The witness, who asked not to be named because of fear of repercussions, said police had detained at least 10 protesters.Accounts posted by witnesses online varied about exactly how the incident started, but largely agreed about the main details.Sometime after 3pm, a migrant worker and his wife and young child were either crossing the road on foot or waiting at a red light on an electric-powered bicycle when a vehicle driven by the officers pulled up behind them.They were intent on jumping the red light, and attempted to force their way through the junction, but the migrant workant worker stood his ground.An argument broke out, after which the eight officers allegedly physically attacked the migrant worker, leaving him seriously injured. Some accounts said the man's wife had also been beaten.The gang fled before police arrived at the scene. The victim then refused to get into an ambulance and lay in the middle of the street, attracting a large audience, which led to a demonstration demanding justice.One grainy video, apparently shot shortly after the attack and later posted online, showed a man lying prone in the centre of a busy street while buses and other vehicles passed close by. At times, a woman could be seen cradling his upper body or lying next to him.Photographs posted on blogs and message boards - many of which were quickly deleted by internet censors - showed the man's face to be severely swollen and bruised, while in some low-resolution pictures the wife also appeared to be injured.Officials of neither Jiuting town nor Songjiang district were available for comment yesterday. The district government issued a statement confirming that police had taken away an unspecified number of individuals after they had ""a traffic dispute with a motorcycle-riding man that led to physical conflict"".

2116,4/22/11,Citizen (China),Government (China),Conduct strike or boycott,Shanghai Shi,19602737,Al Jazeera.net: Chinese Lorry Drivers Continue Strike,"(AL JAZEERA NET) - Striking lorry drivers have gathered in Shanghai's main harbour district for the third day to protest?against high fuel costs and new charges imposed on them by logistics companies.About 600 people gathered outside the office of a logistics company near Baoshan port on Friday, some throwing rocks at lorries driven by those who have not joined the strikers. There are signs that their action is now beginning to affect exports from China's busiest container port. Many of the strikers are independent contractors who carry goods to and from the port. They called a three-day strike starting on Wednesday to demand that the government address their concerns. Some of the striking drivers clashed with police on Thursday, and on Wednesday some overturned a vehicle belonging to the local traffic department. On Friday, as many as 50 police officers had been dispatched to the area, and at least two people were arrested for throwing stones. Talks to take place The crowd dispersed after a policeman said that authorities now plan to meet with the?drivers' representatives to hold talks aimed at ending the strike. He said an announcement would be made on Monday regarding the outcome of the talks. Earlier, workers had told the Reuters news agency that they planned to continue their strike as they had not seen a response from the government. The strike in Shanghai comes against the backdrop of rising consumer prices, with inflation on consumer goods hitting 5.4 per cent in March. Authorities responded by saying they would be making every effort to rein in prices, which continue to rise as the country's GDP continues its steady growth. Exports affected An official at a shipping company told Reuters that the strike has begun to have an effect on exports from the port. ""The strike has delayed exports and many ships cannot take on a full load before leaving,"" Wei Yujun, assistant to the general manager at the China Star Distribution Centre (Shanghai) Company, said. ""For example, if one ship carries 5,000 containers en route to Hong Kong and the US, now they can only carry 1,000 or 2,000 containers,"" Wei added. Another official, who requested anonymity, however, said that the strike has had no effect on exports. In 2010, Shanghai overtook Singapore to become the world's busiest container port, handling 29.05 million?20-foot equivalent units, or TEUs. That number was 500,000 more than Singapore. The unrest is occuring near at least two of the port's five major working zones: Waigaoqiao, a massive free-trade zone and bonded storage warehouse, and Yangshan, a deep water port. Several traders also told Reuters that trade in refined copper was being affected by the strikes, though so far it has only served to cause delays in customs clearance.

A banner is the Mongolian equivalent of a county.The rights group said campuses were guarded by police to prevent student protests. But bloggers who posted online accounts with pictures yesterday said the incident had provoked hundreds of middle school pupils to march to the city-level Xilinhot government office on Tuesday.The demonstrators were protesting against the brutal death of Mergen, an organiser of the banner's Mongolian herders, who tried to stop coal-hauling trucks from taking a shortcut across fragile grazing land, the centre said.The centre posted photos of Monday's demonstration and others said to be of Mergen's body. It said his head had been crushed under the wheels of a 100-tonne coal hauler driven by two Han Chinese drivers on May 10 and his body dragged by the truck for 150 metres.Xinhua yesterday confirmed the brutal killing of Mergen, although local officials reached yesterday played down the demonstrations.Xinhua quoted Shen Wenyin, deputy chief of the Xilingol League government as telling a press conference on Tuesday night that Mergen had been dragged by a coal truck as he attempted to block it. Shen said two Han Chinese drivers, Li Lindong and Lu Xiangdong, had been arrested by police after they fled in a taxi.Shen confirmed that there had been another fatal coal mine dispute in the league's Abag Banner - which online postings said had further provoked the protesters in the past two days. Shen said residents in a mining area in Abag had tried to stop operations at a nearby coal mine on May 14 because of noise, dust and water pollution. One of them, Yan Wenlong, 22, was killed when Sun Shuning, a worker, drove a forklift truck into Yan's car.

All of them survived after receiving emergency medical care. In the flyers, the protesters accused local judicial authorities of forcibly taking their houses, with the headline ""Truths behind the July 1 suicides."" According to a paramedic at the scene, police called for ambulances while trying to take the pesticide from the protesters. The paramedic told Radio Free Asia that when ambulances arrived, an 85-year-old protester was in a critical condition with dilated pupils. However, when asked about the incident, family members of the protesters declined to comment, the paramedic said. Radio Free Asia also interviewed the protesters' families at the hospital and learned the suicide attempt was related to the confiscation of their properties by local authorities. An article describing plans for a mass suicide by a group of farmers on July 1 had surfaced in several online forums in the middle of June. Another online article on June 17 said that although local authorities have subsequently detained some of the farmers, the remaining members of the group promised to carry out their protest as planned. The article also urged internet users to forward the story throughout the online community to prevent the story from being buried. Although several witnesses posted pictures of the incident on the internet, many of the online articles about the protest were quickly deleted in China, the radio service added.

2857,7/18/11,Criminal (China),Police (China),"Protest violently, riot",Zhejiang Sheng,12851107,"Xinhua: Police station in China's Xinjiang attacked, four killed","Text of report by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)Beijing, 18 Jul (Xinhua) - At about 1200 [Beijing time] on 18 July 2011, a number of thugs attacked a public security station in Xinjiang's Hotan City. The thugs stormed into the police station to attack the policemen, hold hostages, and set fire to the police station. Public security personnel and armed policemen speedily rushed to the site, killed on the spot several thugs who were in the act of perpetuating the crime and who were making stubborn resistance, and successfully rescued six hostages.As of 1330, the incident had been under effective control. In the course of the incident, an armed policeman, a joint defense member, and two hostages were killed, and a joint defense member was seriously injured. The work of handling the aftermath is now underway.It has been learned from the Public Security Ministry that the State Anti-Terror Office had dispatched a working group to Xinjiang to provide guidance on the handling work.Source: Xinhua news agency, Beijing, in English 0957gmt 18 Jul 11",Xinhua News,Xinjiang,Hotan City,17,20,"Terror attack_Section: General News - It has been more than a week since China's remote western Xinjiang region was hit by its worst unrest in more than year. Details of the incident still remain sketchy. Chinese state media have reported at least 18 people died after a group of armed attackers stormed a police station in Xinjiang's southern city Hotian. Officials say 14 of those killed were the attackers, but it is still unclear who the alleged assailants were and what led to the violence.Changing accountsFrom the day the incident occurred - on July 18 - the government's characterization of the alleged group of attackers and other details have been evolving. At first, they were labeled as thugs, and later the incident was called a serious violent terrorist attack by state media. However, when authorities raised the number of those killed from four to 18 it called the perpetrators rioters.Overseas Uighur groups are rejecting accounts of the incident outlined in state media and say that at least 20 people were killed and 70 others arrested. They say that fighting between the two sides began when police opened fire on protesters.The initial report was four [dead], now we are up to 20,"" said Nicholas Bequelin, a Hong Kong-based Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""There were accusations of kidnapping and attack with bombs, now there's some other allegations of terrorist training that led to this attack. It's all very confusing and honestly not very convincing from the government side.Despite the confusion, Bequelin says that he is not suggesting that no violence occurred.It would be very careless to ignore that there is a history of violence and anti-state activities in Xinjiang and in southern Xinjiang, in particular. But, likewise, this incident cannot be viewed outside of the larger context, which is one of very broad and severe political suppression of the Uighur by the Chinese state and increased anxieties about the future of the Uighur people, said Bequelin.Home of ethnic UighursXinjiang accounts for about one-sixth of China's overall land mass and is crucial strategically to the country because of its rich deposits of oil and gas and its close proximity to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia. The region is home to many ethnic Uighurs, the region's Turkic-speaking minority population. China accuses some members of this community of seeking independence through violence.Sean Roberts, director of the International Development Studies Program at George Washington University says tensions between Han Chinese and the region's mainly Muslim ethnic group, the Uighurs reaches back to at least the 18th century.But in more recent years, there have been a couple of issues that have been paramount,"" said Roberts. ""One has been the global war on terror and some of the measures that have been taken by the Chinese state to repress Uighur political activity in the name of anti-terrorism, the second thing that is happening now in Xinjiang is that the Chinese state is developing Xinjiang at a breakneck speed.Official accounts of this month's incident have been garnished with details about how the attack was premeditated and how it was allegedly the work of religious extremists.Reports say that the attackers spoke with an ""out of town accent"" and that they purchased their weapons after arriving in town, to not draw any undue attention to themselves. They also are alleged to have flown a Jihadist flag on the roof of the station, during the standoff.There have also been suggestions the attacks were masterminded from outside the country. Some Chinese terrorism analysts have pointed to the influence of groups in neighboring Pakistan.Investigation under wayChina's national counter-terrorism office has dispatched a working team to Xinjiang to investigate the incident, but has yet to comment on the attack.The desert city, Hotian, is located in southwest Xinjiang, near the edge of China's western border with Pakistan and Afghanistan.Analysts note that, in the past, there have been some connections with terrorist groups outside Xinjiang, such as Uighur extremists who were reported to have been killed by a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan last year; the occasional surfacing of videos; and, the fact that Uighurs were among those captured and held in Guantanamo in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks.Bequelin says that, although such links are not implausible, China has also overblown these connections in the past.Every time the police arrest an alleged terrorist group, when they detail the kind of weapons and bombs that they've reportedly found, these tend to show that there is no connection with Pakistan and Afghanistan because the weapons and explosives are just very clearly sort of improvised and made domestically not imported, not trafficked from Central Asia or from Pakistan or Afghanistan where weapons are very readily available, said Bequelin.In the wake of last week's attack police say they confiscated about 30 weapons including daggers, knives, machetes and axes as well as three unused Molotov cocktails, 48 rocks and a sling shot.Local anger or organized terrorism?Raffaello Pantucci, an associate fellow at the International Center for the Study for Radicalization at King's College, says the latest outbreak of violence appeared to be more of an explosion of anger at the local level.On the evidence that we see so far, it's very hard to say they would be, if we were seeing that this is an organized terrorist network that is training in Pakistan in guns and bomb making and is then dispatching people and networks to them come back to China to conduct attacks, I mean the level of attacks we've seen are such a low quality and low caliber, it's very hard to imagine that this is what they are aiming to do, said Pantucci.Chinese state media reports have not named any motive for the attacks aside from the broader goal of separatism and deliberately targeting local political and law departments. They deny claims by overseas Uighur groups that the incident followed protests by local residents.The names of the attackers who were killed or of the four who were taken into custody have yet to be released. Chinese reports say those involved in the incident were between 20 to 40 years of age.State media reports have noted, however, that not all of those who were injured and killed were Han Chinese and that several were minorities. - VOA"

The crowd reportedly killed one of the hijackers.The violence occurred in the town of Kashgar, the old Silk Road city in far western Xinjiang near the border with Tajikistan.Details were still emerging late Sunday, but security officials blamed the upsurge of violence on ""rioters,"" the term often used for Xinjiang's Muslim Uighur separatists who have staged mostly low-level attacks against Chinese government rule. In one of the most brazen attacks, assailants stormed a police station July 18 in Hotan city and took hostages, killing four people before police killed 14 of the attackers, although Uighur exile groups dispute that account of the incident.Residents in telephone interviews and in postings on popular microblogging sites - which have become an alternative news source in China - reported thatKashgar was under a strict curfew Sunday night. One resident posted on a microblog that armored vehicles had been dispatched to the area and people were remaining indoors. Some posted photos on their microblogging Weibo accounts.Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the German-based World Uighur Congress, said that from his information, ""a curfew was imposed on the whole city of Kashgar, and more than 100 Uighurs were detained. The incident is unbelievable, but we have to face it.""He blamed the Beijing government for the latest unrest, saying, ""China must stop the long-systematic policies of repression right now and withdraw the Chinese immigrants, release all the political prisoners and let the Uighurs express their different views and grievances peacefully.""The Turkic-speaking Uighurs consider Xinjiang their traditional homeland, but large influxes of ethnic Han Chinese migrants over the years have left Uighurs a minority. The Uighurs also complain they remain economically disadvantaged, even as China overall has enjoyed double-digit growth rates and improved living standards.Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, said the violence Sunday began about 4:30 p.m. when a bomb exploded in downtown Kashgar. Xinhua initially reported that three people, including a police officer, were killed in the explosion, but a later Xinhua report quoted witnesses saying the three dead were ""hacked to death by rioters.""The news agency later reported that police had shot and killed four suspects after the explosion and that four others had been captured and a manhunt was continuing.The toll from 24 hours of violence would make this one of the bloodiest weekends in Xinjiang since ethnic rioting in July 2009 left nearly 200 people dead and scores of shops and businesses burned down.Since the 2009 riots, China's security forces have clamped down on the region, including installing scores of security cameras.

Local officials said that on the night of Sept. 15 more than 500 people from Hongxiao village started to gather in front of a factory belonging to Zhejiang Jinko Solar, located in the city of Haining, demanding an explanation for the deaths of large swaths of fish in a nearby river last month. Angry protesters stormed the factory compound, overturned eight company vehicles and destroyed the offices before police came to disperse the crowd. The situation, however, may been even more severe. Alternate accounts say that almost 10,000 protesters were gathered by midnight on Sept. 15 and that the local government dispatched anti-riot police to disperse the crowd through the use of tear gas. According to the accounts on the internet, more than ten were dead or injured during the incident. The protest continued for the two following nights with reports of scuffles between police and protesters, the officials said. Chen Hongming, deputy head of Haining's environmental protection bureau, said the factory's waste disposal had failed pollution tests consistently since April. The environmental watchdog has warned the factory, which still has not taken control of its polluting practices, he added. A local villager, surnamed Sun, was said to have circulated a message on the internet on Sept. 8 saying that villagers' health checks had been released, revealing that six have leukemia and 31 have cancer. The village's population is around 3,300. Sun was quickly detained by the police on charges of spreading false rumors. Jinko Solar has not made any statement on the incident, and could not be reached for comment. Protests over pollution concerns have sprouted up across China over the past few years. A protest in 2007 forced the authorities in the southeastern city of Xiamen to scrap a plan to build a petrochemical plant there.

1534,10/6/11,Tibet Autonomous Region,China,Demonstrate or rally,Beijing Shi,20477799,Asia Times: 'Succession Tensions Rise in Tibet',"DHARAMSALA, India - In addition to regular demonstrations, self-immolation is increasingly becoming a way for Tibetan monks inside China to show their faith in and support of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and their frustration over Beijing's intensified suppression of religious freedom and denouncement of their spiritual leader. An escalating verbal battle between Beijing and the Dalai Lama over the latter's reincarnation seems to have intensified protests and prompted more attempted suicides by Tibetan monks to show support of the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. In the past two weeks alone, at least three Tibetan monks from the Kirti monastery in Aba (Ngaba) prefecture in western Sichuan province near the Tibetan border, have set themselves on fire to protest against Beijing's Tibet policy, according to London-based Free Tibet. The latest case of immolation happened on October 3, when a young monk believed to be 17 or 18 years old from the monastery set himself alight near the vegetable market in Aba city. He was reportedly holding a photograph of the Dalai Lama and shouted: ""There are no religious rights and freedoms in Tibet!"" The police put out the fire and took him away. This is the fifth such self-immolation incident this year. A week earlier, on September 26, two young monks, Lobsang Kalsang and Lobsang Konchok aged between 18 and 19 years old, also from Kirti monastery, self-immolated. The monks waved the banned Tibetan flag and called for religious freedom and ""Long live the Dalai Lama"" before they set themselves on fire. Lobsang Kelsang is the brother of Phuntsog, a 21-year-old monk also from Kirti monastery, a site of frequent unrest in the past three years, who died after setting himself on fire in March. China's state-run Xinhua News Agency also reported the September 26 incident, however, it said the two monks were rescued by police shortly after they set fire on themselves and they were given prompt medical treatment. ""The suicide attempt is under further investigation,"" Xinhua said. Besides such suicide attempts, there are also reports about Tibetan protests. According to a report on the website of Radio Free Asia, hundreds of Tibetans staged a protest at the county seat of Seda (Serta) in Ganzi (Kardze) prefecture of Sichuan on China's National Day of October 1. The protest was triggered by the authorities' removal of a portrait of the Dalai Lama and a huge Tibetan national flag from a building and throwing them on the street. The protesters were reported to have shouted slogans calling for the Dalai Lama's return and freedom for Tibetans. The latest self-immolations and protest by Tibetans inside China happened when Beijing and the Dalai Lama were escalating their verbal war over the Dalai Lama's reincarnation. Analysts believe the intensified row has increased frustration among religious Tibetans that Beijing will enforce on them a new Dalai Lama of its choice when the current spiritual leader passes away. On September 24, the Dalai Lama released a statement on his reincarnation saying he would consult Buddhist scholars when he reached the age of ""about 90"" to evaluate whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue, reiterating that the Chinese government has no role whatsoever to play in this matter. ""I shall leave clearly written instructions about this,"" he said. ""Bear in mind that, apart from the reincarnation recognized through such legitimate methods, no recognition or acceptance should be given to a candidate chosen for political ends by anyone, including those in the People's Republic of China."" But Beijing stands firm that the Dalai Lama's reincarnation needs to be endorsed by the central government of China. Two days after the Dalai Lama's statement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the Dalai Lamas had never decided on their own reincarnations, accusing the current Dalai Lama of ""distorting and denying"" history. ""I would like to point out the title of the Dalai Lama is conferred by the central government and is otherwise illegal. The (current) 14th Dalai Lama was approved by the then republican government,"" Hong said. ""There has never been a practice of a living Dalai Lama identifying his own successor."" Tibetan monks both inside and outside Tibet still regard every word of the Dalai Lama as sacred, their God-King, despite the fact that he lives in exile. Despite Beijing's massive economic buildup in infrastructure and increased living standards of Tibetans, its iconoclastic views and hardline policies on culture and religion towards the ethnic minorities remain a challenge. The riots on March 2008 inside Tibet, as well as incessant unrest in Xinjiang in its far west, remind of problematic human-rights situation in China. In some experts' view, Tibetans inside Tibet are very much aware of the geopolitics that surrounds the Dalai Lama's reincarnation and some radical religious believers are willing to take extremes to draw the world's attention to the situation. ""It is tragic that a fifth monk has set fire to himself in Tibet this year... A growing number of Tibetans clearly feel that this is the only way that they can be heard,"" Free Tibet director Stephanie Brigden said in the statement. Dr Dibyesh Anand, associate professor of International Relations from the London's University of Westminster in an e-mail to Asia Times Online said, ""There is a continuing cycle of repression and protests in Tibetan regions in China since 2008, most of it outside the purview of media. The self-immolations should be seen in that context. Monks are aware of the politics the government is playing over the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama and the danger that the same politics will take place over the next Dalai Lama. This realization is part of the picture. But the most important factor here is not the Dalai Lama and his statements but the nature of Chinese rule in Tibet, which allows for no room for accommodation with the most fundamental of Tibetan aspirations to be able to worship their main religious figure."" Suicide is strictly prohibited according to Tibetan Buddhist principles. Nonetheless, after Beijing tightened regulations on Tibetan monasteries after the 2008 unrest in Tibet, self-immolation began to emerge as a new form of protest or sacrifice in Tibet. The first known self-immolation occurred in the exiled Tibetan community on April 27, 1998, when Thupten Ngodup, an exiled Tibetan, set fire to himself during a hunger strike in New Delhi. This year alone at least five Tibetan monks have attempted self-immolation. The first was Phuntsok from Kirti monastery, who set himself ablaze on March 16 to mark the third anniversary of a bloody crackdown on Tibetan demonstrators there. Phuntsok was seized, allegedly beaten by the police and died the next day. The second incident happened on August 15 when 29-year-old monk Tsewang Norbu of Nyitso Monastery in Tawu, Ganzi self-immolated himself demanding freedom in Tibet and the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet. Executive director Urgen Tenzin of the Tibetan Center for Human Rights & Democracy (TCHRD), an exile Tibetan human rights group, told Asia Times Online that ""the monks gets frustrated and are compelled to do such acts because of the policies of the Chinese government. After the 2008 protests the Chinese government has continued their suppression specifically in Tibetan monasteries. ""It is very much evident to the world what is happening inside Tibet. The PRC (People's Republic of China) conducts a 'patriotic re-education' campaign where the monks are forced to denounce the Dalai Lama and their own gurus. Clearly the Communist Party wants them to follow the communist ideology, which is against the Buddhist principles. The latest self-immolation act could be one reason because of the verbal row on the Dalai Lama's reincarnation issue."" Exiled Tibetans here are protesting against China over the latest self-immolation cases, sitting hunger strikes and candle-lit vigils, appealing to the world to pressure China to take steps to improve the human-rights situation inside Tibet. The Tibetan government in exile in an immediate statement after reports of the September 26 self-immolation incident said: The Kashag of the Central Tibetan Administration is deeply saddened by the latest development in Tibet involving two monks setting themselves on fire. The Kashag conveys its heartfelt condolences and prayers to the family members of both individuals. The Central Tibetan Administration calls upon the Chinese authorities to immediately address the grievances of the Tibetan people and resolve the issue of Tibet peacefully. A number of countries and international rights groups too have shown deep concerns over the incident and have objected to Beijing's policies over Tibet. Their statements express their support to the Tibetan exiles. Kristina Ojuland MEP, a former Estonian Foreign Affairs Minister said in a statement: Such a radical form of protest illustrates the despair of the Tibetans, who are seeking freedom of religion as well as meaningful autonomy in the historic area of Tibet. Continuous desperate acts of protest also demonstrate that the Tibetans determinedly resist the ongoing violations of human rights and the cultural genocide that is being carried out in Tibet. Therefore, the European Union and its Member states too cannot remain silent and must address the situation of human rights in Tibet more rigorously with the PRC. The United States State Department too has urged China to respect the rights of Tibetans and address their grievances, in a statement it said: In light of the continuing underlying grievances of China's Tibetan population, we again urge Chinese leaders to respect the rights of Tibetans, to address policies in Tibetan areas that have created tension, and to protect Tibetans' unique religious, cultural and linguistic identity. We continue to urge the Chinese government to allow access to Tibetan areas of China for both journalists and diplomats. Beijing quickly rebuked the statement, ""We oppose any country or any person using Tibet-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs and impair China's social stability and ethnic unity,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told journalists. ""The Chinese government protects the lawful rights and interests of ethnic minorities,"" he said. Leading experts on Tibet suggest the situation inside Tibet is not what Beijing portrays to the world, with imposed monastic laws making monks uncomfortable. However, the self-immolations are a clear messages to Beijing. Associate professor Elliot Sperling, an expert on the history of Tibet and Tibetan-Chinese relations at Indiana University, tells Asia Times Online: The current instances of self-immolation by Tibetan monks in protest to Chinese policies have raised serious concerns, inside China and outside, that this particular form of protest will not end here. It is no longer possible for China to shroud such actions in secrecy in spite of attempts to impose a news blackout. Moreover, as a powerful form of political protest by Buddhist monks, self-immolation has a decades-old history going back to protests in (South) Vietnam in the early 1960s. Dr Dibyesh Anand, associate professor of International Relations says: Self-immolation of monks reflects a deep dissatisfaction amongst the Tibetans inside China. At the same time this desperate act is also one of hope, a hope that such sacrifices will mobilize more Tibetans; bring international attention and hopefully more international pressure on China to accommodate the legitimate aspirations of Tibetans. That the monks are at the forefront of this should not be a surprise since they have borne the brunt of all kinds of pressures from the government to be patriotically re-educated. However, this form of protest is dangerous for Tibetans too. If such acts are represented as the highest form of sacrifice one can make for the cause of Tibet and individuals are extolled as true patriots, we should not be surprised that more and more Tibetans will follow suit. Self-immolation is not non-violent for it is violence against one-self. And once violence of any kind enters a struggle, it raises the cost of protest, brutalizes people and even makes it easier for the state to act with far greater violence. It is one thing for the exiled Tibetans to mobilize awareness campaigns around these acts, and it is another to venerate them as legitimate sacrifice for the danger here is of more copycat self-immolations.

1539,10/24/11,Citizen (China),Business (China),Demonstrate or rally,Shanghai Shi,20400428,Caixin Wang: Dropping Real Estate Prices Draw Shanghai Protests,"After years of waiting for real estate prices to decline, many Chinese citizens are probably welcoming the fact that home prices have been flatlining, and even decreasing, in some parts of the country.Homeowners in Shanghai, however, are not so happy. Over the weekend, about 300 homeowners living in Shanghai's Pudong district gathered at the China Overseas Property Group Co. office to demand that the company refund or cancel their purchase contracts, following news that the developer had reduced prices for the development from 22,000 yuan to 16,000 yuan per square meter.After China Overseas Property announced that it would neither refund nor cancel the contracts, a clash between security officers and civilians ensued, resulting in the destruction of the company's sign and two large-scale models of the apartment complex. China Overseas is a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-listed China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd.""My house's value has dropped by as much as one-third, and we have lost some 10,000yuan,"" a homeowner surnamed Yang told Shanghai Daily.Since last year, the Chinese government has introduced a series of measures aimed at curbing real estate market prices, such as bans on buying second homes, minimum down payment hikes and the instatement of property taxes. In response, developers have slashed prices to maintain their bottom line and attract customers.Over the past few weeks, property owners in Shanghai have rallied in various spots around the city to protest markdowns in their home equity. Recently, prices in Shanghai's Yujinxian development dropped from 23,000 to 17,000 yuan per square meter; in the Longhu Licheng community, they fell from 18,000 to 14,000 yuan per square meter; and in the Greenland Qiuxia complex, they went from 19,000 to 13,000 yuan per square meter. The Pudong protest was the largest yet.Speaking to the Oriental Morning Post, a lawyer named Jiang Zhimin said companies are allowed to change their prices, and that homeowners have no legal means of stopping a developer from slashing prices, unless stipulated by contract.Beijing has also seen declines in real estate prices. Since last September, prices have decreased by 20 percent and by even 50 percent in other suburban parts of the capital. Fearing homeowner backlash, some developers said they are afraid to lower prices.In a commentary released October 24, Xinhua News Agency hinted that China's home prices may drop further due to the government's ongoing macroeconomic efforts at stemming the real estate boom. The National Bureau of Statistics' latest numbers show that the cost of new homes in 24 out of 70 Chinese cities rose in September from August. Their month-on-month price increases, however, were no more than 0.3 percent.A spokesman for the agency said the slowdown was a sign that ""rapid rise in property prices has been markedly contained.""[Description of Source: Beijing Caixin Wang in English ?

1562,12/15/11,Citizen (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Guangdong Sheng,20125010,Caixin Wang: Wukan Village Under Police Siege,"Police have surrounded an entire village in Guangdong Province, after the death of a protest leader stoked an outpouring of anger and protests. A village in Guangdong Province is now under siege by Chinese police, after tensions escalated between residents and local officials over the death of a protest leader in custody. Since September, citizen anger has been simmering in the 20,000-person village of Wukan, with thousands of residents staging massive protests against the forced sale of farmland to property developers.Then, the death of 42-year-old Xue Jingbo was the last straw. In the days following his death on December 11, villagers have taken to the streets, and the last of Wukan's communist party officials have fled the area. The village is now under siege, after 1,000 armed officers failed to retake the town Sunday, The Telegraph reports. No food or water may enter the area, and no villagers may leave. The rebel leaders say they have enough food for ten days.Police officials arrested and detained Xue on December 9 on the charges of intentionally destroying property and obstructing official business. He was one of 13 citizen representatives selected to negotiate with local officials following the latest protest on November 21, and had organized a few protests in September as well.Descriptions forwarded on microblogs in the last few days (which have since been removed) said that Xue's body had broken bones and removed fingernails, Southern Metropolis Daily reported. Two separate hospital accounts and Guangdong provincial officials, however, say otherwise.According to local government officials, Xue felt uncomfortable at 10:51p.m on December 11 and sent to the No. 2 Shanwei Hospital. According to a doctor there, Xue died of heart failure. A subsequent autopsy performed by Sun Yat-sen University Forensic Identification Center reported that Xue's ten fingernails were intact and that there were no signs of fractures except for slight abrasions on his wrists and knees, caused by cuffs.Then, two days after Xue's death, the Guangdong Provincial Procuratorate ruled that his death was not caused by external factors, upon reviewing the Sun Yat-sen University autopsy. It also added that the investigation's specific details are still pending. Many in Wukan, including Xue's family, are convinced that he was killed in custody. In the last few days, 8,000 villagers have gathered at village committee meetings, demanding explanations for why Xue was dead.For days, rumors circulated that two other villagers named Zhang Jiangcheng and Zhuang Liehong, who were detained along with Xue, had been sent to a nearby hospital's intensive care unit with muscles from their hands and legs sliced away. But in a December 14 Xinhua News Network television report, Chinese state media filmed Zhang's family visiting him in detention. ""Someone spread this rumor in order to escalate conflicts between the villagers and the local government,"" he said. ""We live well here.""

In much of Guangdong province, conflicts have been intense because the area is among China's most economically developed, pushing up land prices.In Wukan, a village to the southwest of Haimen, protesters drove local authorities from the area nearly two weeks ago over a land dispute. Wukan protesters reached by phone Tuesday said plans for a large march on a nearby government office on Wednesday would go ahead.In Haimen, some protesters clashed with police, leaving dozens hurt including women and police. Some in the crowd speculated that one man who was lying on the ground bleeding from his head had died, but that could not be confirmed, Chen said.""We don't have any weapons, only mineral water bottles and we threw them at the police but the police were using batons to beat people up,"" Chen said in a phone interview. He estimated that around 20,000 people participated in the demonstration.The protesters had first gathered in the morning at the office of the Haimen government and demanded a meeting with the township party secretary, Chen said.A woman who answered the phone at the Haimen government office said the protesters had left and then hung up.The protesters think that an existing coal-fired power plant has contributed to what they say is a spike in cancer cases and heavy pollution in the seas, a serious problem for a town where fishing is a source of livelihood.""People are worried about the pollution that will be released by the (new) power plant,"" said Wang Xiebo, a fisherman reached by phone.Another protester, a man surnamed Yang, provided a similar account of the protest and subsequent clash.""Two or three of us fainted on the ground when they fired tear gas at us,"" Yang said. ""The government offended us again and again by trying to build a power plant. This is going to affect our future generations. They still need to live,"" Yang said.Photos circulating on China's popular Twitter-like microblog Weibo showed a crowd of protesters amassed at a large government building and then at a highway, as well as riot police with plastic shields and helmets lined up in tight rows. Some photos showed protesters and police injured and bleeding.After three decades of laxly regulated industrialization, China is seeing a surge in protests over such environmental worries.In September, hundreds of villagers in an eastern Chinese city near Shanghai demonstrated against pollution they blamed on a solar panel factory. In August, 12,000 residents in the northeastern port city of Dalian protested against a chemical plant after waves from a tropical storm broke a dike guarding the plant and raised fears that flood waters could release toxic chemicals.------Follow Gillian Wong on Twitter at http://twitter.com/gillianwong",AP,Guangdong,Haimen,5,30000,"coal-fired power plant because of concerns about pollution.

""In fact the new system is a better deal, as workers end up with about 20 per cent more pay without the need for overtime on Saturdays and Sundays."" He said workers now have higher expectations.The manager likened the strike to a three-day walkout earlier this week at the Nanjing plant of South Korean electronics manufacturer LG Display, which management also blamed on a misunderstanding.""Following negotiations, we managed to bring the dispute to a happy ending for everyone,"" he said, while declining to provide details of any deal that workers were offered.Dissatisfaction over annual bonus payments at Ahresty Precsty Precision Die Mold, a Japanese-owned maker of vehicle engine parts, resulted in a mass walkout late on Tuesday afternoon, according to accounts posted online.Staff at the Guangzhou plant confirmed the strike had occurred, but would not comment on the details yesterday afternoon.A spokeswoman for the Luogang district government said the dispute had been resolved after Labour Bureau officials stepped in to handle talks yesterday after two days of strike by the workers.She said workers were given bonuses twice that of their salaries last year, but they were offered bonuses this year of just 1-1/2 times because the firm was affected by natural disasters in Japan earlier this year.She was also unable to say whether the bonus offer was increased.[Description of Source: Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English -- Website of well-respected non-PRC-owned daily newspaper and Hong Kong's most prominent English-language daily; features extensive original reporting on Hong Kong and PRC political issues and an even-handed editorial line; URL: http://www.scmp.com]",Hong Kong South China Morning Post Online in English,Guangdong,Yangjiang Nagu Technology in Yangjiang,13,1000,http://www.aboluowang.com/2011/1230/230555.html

They also stopped demonstrators from boarding trains bound for the capital, according to a post on a weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter.AFP calls to the Anyang city government went unanswered.Anyang has been plagued by illegal investment schemes, which offer higher interest rates than banks. Many investors have been left out of pocket after the operators of the scams went broke and fled, previous reports said.Authorities launched a crackdown in September, arresting more than 100 people and investigating more than 40 companies suspected of being involved in the multi-million-dollar schemes.But the city government on Sunday admitted to ""weak links in our handling of illegal fundraising schemes"" and pledged to recover investors' money, the Anyang Daily said in a story carried on the city government's website.Limited investment options and low interest rates offered by the major banks have prompted many Chinese seeking better returns for their money to invest in the country's property market and illegal get-rich-quick schemes.The Anyang protest is the latest incident in China where residents have taken to the streets to oppose land seizures, pollution and perceived official corruption.Last month residents of a village in the southern province of Guangdong faced off with authorities for more than a week after driving out local party officials they say had been stealing their land for years.The revolt against officialdom in Wukan ended after a senior provincial official said their complaints about land seizures were reasonable and agreed to release detained villagers.Locals of Haimen town, also in Guangdong, clashed with police last month after they blocked a highway to protest a planned power plant expansion, which authorities later promised to suspend.amj/cc/pst",NA,Henan,"Anyang, a city in Henan, train station",4,1000,Investment Scam       http://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/ql1-01022012090632.html

Most have chanted for Tibetan freedom and the return of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who fled to India amid an abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959.Woeser, a Beijing-based Tibetan poet and activist, posted accounts of the unrest on Twitter that were similar to those reported by the groups.""A young Tibetan person self-immolated ... the local area has erupted in public protests and marches, and they have been met with military police fire and suppression. There are Tibetan casualties,"" she wrote. Like some Tibetans, Woeser uses just one name.The claims could not be independently confirmed. Calls to Aba county's police bureau rang unanswered. A man who answered the phone Sunday at the Aba prefecture government said they hadn't received any reports about a self-immolation or clashes and then hung up. People answering the phones at the lower Aba county and township governments also said they had no information.Heavy security has turned Aba and the surrounding area into a virtual restricted zone since an anti-government uprising across Tibetan communities in 2008, and foreign reporters have had little or no access.China chooses Buddhist leaders in Tibet and wants to pick a pro-Beijing successor to the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing considers to be a separatist.

Li Hongding , a 32-year-old villager, said it was their third rally outside the headquarters; their previous appeals were ignored. He said they were worried that all the land in their now-urban village would soon be gone if an investigation into the local government's actions was delayed further.""With the collective power of our villagers, we want to get our voices heard by the government during the provincial people's congress,"" Li said. ""Communist rule in Wanggang village has clearly been replaced by corrupted power affiliated with triad gangs. If our problems are not solved, Wanggang will become Guangdong's second Wukan. The land is left by our ancestors, we will fight until the end to get it back.""Xie Xiaodan , a newly appointed deputy mayor of Guangzhou who oversees areas including public security and petitioning, was sent to meet villagers after 5pm. Five villagers were chosen to meet Xie inside the Guangzhou petitions office next to the city headquarters.A lengthy article by Wang, whose peaceful settlement of the Wukan uprising earned him widespread praise, appeared yesterday in the Communist Party journal Qiushi (Seeking Truth). In it, he stressed the need to put people's interests first.Wang has come under pressure since the Wukan settlement from hardliners who warned that his conciliatory approach could lead to more protests. Deputy Guangdong party chief Zhu Mingguo brokered a peace deal last month in Wukan, near Shanwei in eastern Guangdong, that ended months of protests over government land grabs.Wang wrote that increasing public awareness of democratic rights meant that the government ""should be more scientific and targeted when seeking good for the public. The government should cater to the public when drafting public policies.""Yesterday's protesters carried colourful flags and large white banners near People's Park, denouncing their village government as corrupt. Villagers have accused village party secretary Li Zhihang of leasing collective land and pocketing more than 400 million yuan (HK$491 million), embezzling up to 850,000 yuan from village co-operatives, and intervening in local elections.Li Zhihang was seen outside the headquarters, trying to convince villagers to return to Wanggang. He refused to comment on their accusations. Guangzhou police tried to seal off the protest and stop journalists talking to him.Villagers said Xie met their representatives for about 40 minutes and was urged to immediately suspend Li Zhihang and investigate him for graft. Villagers who returned from the meeting said Xie rejected that demand but had promised an immediate investigation, with a reply by February 19.A few hundred dissatisfied villagers were still demonstrating outside the headquarters late last night. They said they did not have written confirmation from the petition office promising them a reply by February 19 and would stay outside the building until the office reopened this morning to get a reply in writing.""We fear reprisals when we return to Wanggang,"" one 53-year-old villager said.

One person died and 32 were injured, and the crowd dispersed around three hours later,"" the monks, who would not be named, told AFP.They relayed each other over the phone to tell the story in halting Mandarin.Rights groups with contacts in the area and the India-based Tibetan government-in-exile also confirmed the incident took place.Xinhua had a slightly different version of the incident, saying dozens of people gathered outside a bus station in Luhuo after a man put up posters claiming a monk would set himself on fire there.""The protest turned violent at around 2 pm, as the crowd began attacking a police station with clubs and stones,"" it said.""One protester was killed in the following clash with the police, which also left five officers injured,"" it added.Police and the local Communist Party committee in Luhuo said they were unaware of the incident when contacted by AFP.The London-based Free Tibet and the US-based International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) said Tibetans from nearby counties were reported to be converging on the nearby Dragko Monastery on Monday to join demonstrators.Free Tibet said the man killed was called Yonten and his body was taken to the monastery, where the injured people had also gathered. One of those hurt was described as having a bullet wound in his stomach.""Due to fears for their safety, Tibetans who were injured are unable to seek treatment at the local government-run hospital,"" ICT said.Both rights groups confirmed the protest came after unknown people posted leaflets in the area that included a declaration by a Tibetan of his or her intention to set fire to themselves.Aside from religious repression, many Tibetans in China also complain their culture is being eroded by an influx of majority Han Chinese people in the areas they live in.But Beijing denies it uses repressive methods against Tibetans, insisting they enjoy freedom of religious belief and that huge ongoing investment into Tibetan-inhabited areas has greatly raised their standard of living.Stephanie Brigden, head of Free Tibet, called on the international community to condemn the incident.""This is the largest reported shooting of Tibetans since 2008 and demonstrates the deepening crisis in Tibet,"" she said.Lhasa, capital of the Tibet autonomous region that neighbours Sichuan, was hit by riots against Chinese rule in March 2008, and unrest subsequently spread to nearby Tibetan-inhabited areas, where protests occurred for months after.Since then, authorities have increased security in these areas and the situation remains tense.According to ICT, monks, nuns and lay people in Luhuo were fired upon by police in March 2008 when they held a peaceful protest.In the last reported self-immolation earlier this month in Aba -- another county in Sichuan -- rights groups said police fired on hundreds of locals as they attempted to rescue the burned body from officials.The government-in-exile said in a statement on its website that it was ""deeply aggrieved by the incidents (in Dragko) and condemns the Chinese authorities for resorting to such drastic acts of force and repression.""Beijing blames the Dalai Lama -- who fled Tibet following a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959 and is vilified as a ""separatist"" by Communist authorities -- for much of the unrest in Tibetan-inhabited regions.mbx/emb",NA,Sichuan,Luhuo county,6,1000,http://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/ql2-01242012092344.html

Some were bleeding, some were beaten down on the ground,"" the US-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC) quoted a protestor as saying.A local government official reached by AFP denied the confrontation was violent.""I know there is a land dispute, but no violent clashes happened,"" said the official of the township which governs the area. Another township official denied any such incident had occurred.In May last year, the vast region experienced a wave of demonstrations sparked by the killing of a protesting Mongol herder. There has long been resentment at Chinese rule and exploitation of the area's natural resources.The Mongol herder was run over by a coal truck driven by a member of China's dominant Han ethnic group as he and others sought to block a convoy of vehicles. The driver was later sentenced to death.According to SMHRIC, villagers in the latest incident said they had protested at the local level for months and even tried to petition the central government in Beijing over the alleged land grab.But this time, the local government responded with force, dispatching more than 80 paramilitary soldiers to put down the protest, it said.Confrontations between Han Chinese and Mongols have laid bare simmering discontent in Inner Mongolia, a vast region that separates China from the country of Mongolia.Many Mongols complain Chinese culture is swamping their way of life, and a government policy to move herders off the steppe to preserve the environment is widely considered a pretext to seize land, further fuelling resentment.bxs/mbx/jit",Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC),Inner Mongolia,"Tongliao city, iang Dao, Naiman Qi, Tongliao Shi, Neimenggu Zizhiqu",2,100,"Chinese authorities have arrested 22 people in Inner Mongolia for protesting over a land dispute,                 http://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/nmg-04032012150444.html"

Those who suffered minor injuries in the clashes were all sent to hospitals.A local official who requested anonymity said the protest was triggered by an earlier merger between the former Wansheng district and Qijiang county, which were regrouped as Qijiang district at the end of last year.Disgruntled residents from Wansheng complained that their business was affected after the merger while some worried about the lowering of their healthcare standard.Chongqing Mayor Huang Qifan rushed to the scene to persuade the protestors to return, and the municipal government issued a guide on Wednesday, promising the smooth economic development of Wansheng by offering preferential policies to former Wansheng residents.Officials from the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said the protest was related to the people's economic interests, and had no connection with the case of Wang Lijun, Chongqing's former police chief, or the investigation of Bo Xilai, former Party chief of Chongqing.[Description of Source: Beijing Xinhua in English -- China's official news service for English-language audiences (New China News Agency)]",Beijing Xinhua in English,Chongqing,Wansheng economic development zone of Qijiang district,3,10000,http://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/m0412-hc-04122012161201.html            economic decline and reductions in social welfare and healthcare benefits.

1732,7/10/12,Citizen (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Guangdong Sheng,16999187,Around 600 protest in south China city over car quota system - Hong Kong paper,"Text of report by Mimi Lau in Guangzhou headlined ""600 in Protest Over Car Quota System"" published by Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post website on 10 JulyAbout 600 owners of second-hand car dealerships in Guangzhou protested yesterday against the city's new vehicle-registration quota system, saying it had effectively put them out of business.The dealers, including those from remote districts such as Conghua, Zengcheng, Huadu and Panyu, gathered in People's Park near a popular shopping district in the morning, then demonstrated in front of the city government headquarters and went to the Guangdong provincial government offices in the afternoon.Luo Jialiang, 53, the owner of a second-hand car business with more than 30 cars in stock, organised the demonstration. He said the policy, announced with only a few hours' notice last week, was destructive to their livelihoods.""It is unreasonable to limit the sales of used cars, as it has no impact on the overall volume of Guangzhou's cars,"" Luo said. ""Transactions of second-hand cars should not be capped. We are very angry.""Another owner of a second-hand car dealership said she expected that at least 40,000 people would be out of a job in Guangzhou due to the policy, and that about 1,500 second-hand dealers would be forced to close or relocate.A number of car dealerships have also closed their doors for the whole of July, after authorities said all car registrations, including second-hand filings, would be suspended for the month as details of the plan were still being sorted out.""We are still paying rent and wages for our workers,"" the owner said, declining to give her name. ""What are we going to do?""The car-quota policy was implemented on July 1, just three hours after it was announced by the Guangzhou Municipal Transport Commission on the night of June 30. The move was criticised as being too hasty and carried out without public consultation.However, authorities said the cap was necessary to curb the city's worsening gridlock and air pollution. Announcing the plan ahead of time would have surely resulted in a rush by many people to buy cars, which would have lessened the desired effects of such a quota.Under the new policy, new car registrations are capped at 10,000 a month, starting in August, or 120,000 a year. About 226,000 cars were sold in the city last year.Guangzhou is the fourth mainland city - after Beijing, Shanghai and Guiyang - where the local authorities have introduced administrative measures to control car sales.""We don't understand the rationale of the government limiting registration of second-hand vehicles, as our businesses would not increase the total car volume in the city,"" Luo said. ""We want the government to give second-hand cars a one-year grace period and to review whether it is really necessary to impose such a ban, with academic research and expert opinions to back up (the review).""Source: South China Morning Post website, Hong Kong, in English 10 Jul 12","South China Morning Post website, Hong Kong, in English",Guangdong,Guangzhou,4,600,http://www.rfa.org/cantonese/news/drivers_protest-07122012111151.html

2195,7/28/12,Protester (China),Government (China),"Obstruct passage, block",Jiangsu Sheng,17030735,UPDATE 1-China cancels waste project after protests turn violent,"(Recasts)QIDONG, China, July 28 (Reuters) - Chinese officials cancelled an industrial waste pipeline project on Saturday after anti-pollution demonstrators occupied a government office in eastern China, destroying computers and overturning cars.The demonstration was the latest in a string of protests sparked by fears of environmental degradation and highlights the social tensions the government in Beijing faces as it approaches a leadership transition this year.It was also the second cancellation of an industrial project this month, as officials buckle under pressure from protests.Zhang Guohua, city mayor of the eastern China city of Nantong, said in a statement the city would terminate the planned pipeline that would have emptied waste water from a Japanese-owned paper factory via the coastal town of Qidong into the sea.The decision came hours after about 1,000 protesters marched through the city of Qidong, about one hour north of Shanghai, shouting slogans against the pipeline.Several protesters entered the city government's main building and were seen smashing computers, overturning desks and throwing documents out the windows to loud cheers from the crowd. Reuters witnessed five cars and one minibus being overturned.At least two police officers were dragged into the crowd at the government office and punched and beaten enough to make them bleed.Environmental worries have stoked calls for expanded rights for citizens and greater consultation in the tightly controlled one-party state.The outpouring of public anger is emblematic of the rising discontent facing Chinese leaders, who are obsessed with maintaining stability and struggling to balance growth with rising public anger over environmental threats.The protest followed similar demonstrations against projects the Sichuan town of Shifang earlier this month and in the cities of Dalian in the northeast and Haimen in southern Guangdong province in the past year.The leadership has vowed to clean up China's skies and waterways and increasingly tried to appear responsive to complaints about pollution. But environmental disputes pit citizens against local officials whose aim is to lure fresh investment and revenue into their areas.(Additional reporting by Carlos Barria; Editing by Nick Macfie)",Reuters,Jiangsu,"Qidong Nantong Shi,",5,10000,"waste water discharge project:                 http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/simp/chinese_news/2012/07/120728_china_protest.shtml           Some of the protesters in Qidong in Jiangsu province clashed with police and turned a patrol car on its side. After the protest Saturday, the Qidong government announced on its website that plans to build the water discharge project had been scrapped.The official Xinhua News Agency said thousands of residents took to the streets but dispersed after the government announcement. Later Saturday hundreds of police, some in riot gear, arrived in the coastal town just north of Shanghai and took up positions outside the government offices.     Thousands of locals surrounded Qidong government offices on Saturday morning as protestors clashed with police, leading to scores of injuries and even rumors of at least two deaths. Hundreds of armed police from Nantong, which administers Qidong, were despatched to the area in an effort to suppress the growing violence and looting of government offices. The number of demonstrators varied widely from source to source. Chinese netizens claimed there were as many as 100,000 protestors, while France's AFP reported around 50,000 participants. Official Chinese media said roughly 10,000 people took part. The Qidong government eventually relented and promised to abandon its plans of building a 100 km pipeline from a city factory run by Japan's Oji Paper Co that would have pumped up to 150,000 tons of waste per day to China's east coast."

Tongren government and security officials could not immediately be reached for comment.The protests followed reports of clashes in the neighbouring province of Sichuan on Monday, where two ethnic Tibetans set themselves on fire on Monday to protest Chinese rule, leading to bloody clashes between residents and police.""Tensions are high as Tibetans are not prepared to sit back and allow Chinese state oppression to continue unchallenged,"" said Free Tibet director Stephanie Brigden.Exile groups say nearly 50 ethnic Tibetans, many of them Buddhist monks and nuns, have set themselves on fire since March 2011 to protest restrictions on their religious freedom.An influx of Han Chinese, the country's largest ethnic group, to China's vast Tibetan-inhabited areas has also created tensions.Violent anti-government protests in the Tibetan capital in Lhasa in 2008 later spread to other areas populated by Tibetans, prompting tight security in these regions that has at times led to clashes.Beijing insists Tibetans are free to practise their religion and have benefited from improved living standards under Chinese rule.cdh/cc/ac[Description of Source: Hong Kong AFP in English -- Hong Kong service of the independent French press agency Agence France-Presse]",Hong Kong AFP in English,Qinghai,Tongren county,8,100,http://www.rfa.org/cantonese/news/tibetan_a-08152012111802.html
1758,8/16/12,Activist (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Beijing Shi,17135647,SCMP: 'Shots Fired - At Least in Print',"China's state media issued a stark warning to Japan yesterday over interfering in the Diaoyus, with a Communist Party mouthpiece saying Beijing is prepared to take action to defend its sovereignty over the disputed islands. The rhetoric came as about 30 mainland activists protested at the Japanese embassy in Beijing, demanding China declare war against Japan to claim the islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan.Waving Chinese national flags, the protestors chanted slogans demanding China take action against Tokyo after Japan arrested five Chinese activists who landed on the islands. Seven others on the boat were arrested ""China should declare war against Japan to claim back the Diaoyu Islands,"" one banner read. Police stepped up security around the embassy, but the protestors were largely uninterrupted. They presented a letter, with a blade enclosed, addressed to Japan's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda. ""Noda commits a crime that is unforgivable by Chinese people,"" the letter said. ""Your only way out is to cut open your belly with the blade."" Chen Fule, one of the activists, said they had no plan to sail to the islands as they ""were having difficulty in renting a boat"". In a move seen as indicating Beijing is preparing to take tough action, a commentary in the overseas edition of People's Daily said China had no reason to tolerate Japan's actions and could respond to the dispute in a way similar to its handling of tensions with the Philippines over the Scarborough Shoal, known as Huangyan Island, in the South China Sea. Action taken by Beijing over the shoal dispute included curbing imports of bananas from the Philippines, and warnings from officials Beijing was prepared to take necessary action to defend its territory. ""If diplomatic rhetoric does not calm Japan down, then only action can force Japan to retreat,"" said the commentary written by Jia Xiudong, a researcher at the China Institute of International Studies. The commentary said China would not hesitate to ""eradicate Japan's illusion to get control of the Diaoyu Islands"". The Global Times , published under People's Daily , warned in an editorial that ""Japan must abandon the illusion that China will retreat in the face of Tokyo's provocation"". ""Japan has to make a choice: back up and create the conditions to reduce tensions ... or head into a full confrontation with China. Whatever Japan's choice, China will respond accordingly,"" it said. ""China has no reason to compromise with Japan over the issue."" In Taipei, several dozen activists demonstrated in front of Japan's de facto embassy. ""Stop occupying Diaoyu Islands,"" they shouted outside Japan's Interchange Association, which represents Japan in Taiwan in the absence of official ties. ""Despite all odds, we will never give up and we will do all we can to go to the Diaoyu Islands and declare our sovereignty over them,"" said Yin Pi-hsiung of the Taipei-based Chung Hwa Baodiao Alliance. Yin and three others were forced to cancel plans to join Hong Kong counterparts in travelling to the islands after the boat skipper refused to sail, in what they say was ""pressure from government authorities."" Taiwan's foreign ministry, however, said the government would never obstruct any fishing boat operations as long as they were legal. On a proposal by some Taiwanese activists that Taipei should co-operate with Beijing in asserting sovereignty over the island group, foreign ministry spokesman Steve Hsia said: ""We will never co-operate with the mainland over this issue.""

The patients have asked for an extension of their free-drug programs, an increase in designated hospitals for AIDS treatment, compensation for their economic losses and financial aid for their children's tuition fees, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. The officials failed to answer them as promised and have repeatedly skirted the issue. On Monday, the protesters tried to enter the office but were beaten back by baton-wielding police officers. Some of them were dragged into the building by police, according to the BBC. In 1995, the blood collection program paid poor farmers and peasants in the province to draw and extract plasma from their blood. Their blood was transfused back into their bodies after extraction. However, the procedure was conducted without any safety protection or screening and often with contaminated and reused equipment, causing massive numbers of HIV infections in the province. Local officials were said to have covered up the pandemic, which may have caused hundreds of thousands of cases of infection in the area.

""When someone told me the man had died, I went back to the scene at about 6.30pm and found out that was true."" She said she had not noticed any injuries on the man's body.

Although no casualties were reported, it says seven police cars were burned during the unrest. Online reports say police used tear gas to disperse the protesters, who attacked police with rocks and bottles.State media quickly denied reports that the man, identified as Luzhou resident Gan Junyuan, was beaten by police. The Communist Party-controlled Global Times quoted officials who said he died of an ""acute disease"" after being told to move his illegally parked vehicle. Xinhua said Gan ""suddenly felt uncomfortable"" and died while scuffling with police. It said doctors who were called to the scene were not able to save his life.Pictures and video circulated on Chinese social media, which could not be independently verified, show a body lying motionless next to a truck as police held back protesters.The local government has promised to conduct an investigation.Tens of thousands of riots break out across China every year in response to police brutality, land grabs, factory pollution and other grievances. So far, the protests have been localized and have not posed a serious threat to the rule of China's Communist Party.The party is working hard to enforce calm ahead of a sensitive once-a-decade leadership transition that begins next month with its 18th Party Congress in Beijing. - VOA"

The report notes that the residents reacted strongly for fear that the thermal power plant, which involves an investment of 3.9 billion yuan, will contaminate the environment. The armed police fired large numbers of tear-gas canisters, and the report states that the residents used bricks, Molotov cocktails, and fire torches to fight back. As a result, around 100 residents were injured and 50 were arrested, the report adds.??(See?attached vernacular: ic1022a.pdf)?

In 2007, thousands of people in east China's city of Xiamen protested the construction of a paraxylene (PX) plant over health concerns. The plant was eventually relocated.Last year, authorities in northeast China's city of Dalian ordered a PX chemical plant to shut down after local residents took to the streets to demand that the plant be relocated over concerns regarding possible toxic chemical leaks.Similar protests have also been reported in the cities of Chengdu, Nanjing and Qingdao.Source: Xinhua news agency, Beijing, in English 1206gmt 24 Oct 12",Xinhua News,Zhejiang,Ningbo Petrochemical Economic and Technical Development Zone in the Zhenhai District,5,10000,"Escalate (PX)    http://www.boxun.com/news/gb/china/2012/10/201210282202.shtml#.VM6idFXF8Sg                NINGBO, China, Oct. 28 -- More than 3,000 people marched in the streets of the eastern China city of Ningbo on Sunday to protest a local chemical plant expansion project, which they say would harm public health and cause environmental pollution.The protesters blasted the Ningbo municipal government for backing the chemical plant project and called for the resignation of Ningbo mayor.Local residents have gathered every day in front of the Ningbo municipal government over the past week, and the turnout Sunday was the largest so far.China has been hit by a series of protests in recent months by angry residents complaining about environmental pollution caused by the construction of new industrial plants.At least two industrial projects, a metallurgical plant in Sichuan Province and a waste-water treatment plant in Jiangsu Province, were scrubbed in July in the wake of public protests.Responding to Internet postings, residents in Ningbo gathered in the city's business district Sunday morning and later marched toward the municipal office, where they were held back by riot police guarding the government premises.The protesters demanded that the municipal government revoke the decision giving the go-ahead for the chemical plant expansion project and that the mayor resign to take responsibility.Apparently in a bid to ease public anger, Ningbo authorities said Sunday the mayor and other senior city officials met with representatives of the residents the previous day to listen to their views on the chemical plant project.""We will continue to seek the public's opinion,"" a statement released by the city said.==Kyodo                       According to the Hong Kong Information Center for Human Rights & Democracy (30 October), a Hong Kong-based fax service which reports on dissidence, about 5,000 armed police reinforcements sent in from other areas since 27 October have not been withdrawn from Ningbo as the authorities are still concerned about a possible mass rally or protest over a Sinopec plant expansion plan.?It was reported that the Ningbo protest may reach?a climax again this weekend as people from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other areas may join the protest.?More than 200 protesters, some of them elderly, were beaten by the special and armed police during the five-day clash over the plant expansion.?

Hundreds of the protestors in Liuliang and Fangbei villages were injured after confronting police, in a bid to stop construction of a 220-kilovolt substation. The project would require building high-voltage power lines over their homes, which some feared could threaten their health. At least four police cars and a local media van were badly damaged in the clashes, which involved protests in each of the two villages. The earlier protest, in Liuliang, involved about 1,000 villagers and 2,000 police, the Hong Kong-based Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy said yesterday. Two police cars were smashed and officers closed roads to the restive village. A smaller protest in Fangbei continued until yesterday afternoon, when police called in reinforcements to help disperse some 300 villagers, said one resident who uploaded a video of the scene to the internet. The footage shows police firing tear gas at stone-throwing protesters. Local residents have been trying to stop the project for more than a year and have petitioned in the provincial capital of Hangzhou , as well as Beijing. Protesters reportedly clashed with police during a rally outside the township's government headquarters last year. ""So far, authorities haven't responded to us on this,"" a villager said. ""They haven't given us any money for this damaging project, either, although they always claim that they have distributed compensation to us."" Disputes over large construction projects are occurring with increasing regularity on the mainland, including a successful effort to stop the expansion of a petrochemical plant in Ningbo last month. Last week, Environment Minister Zhou Shengxian blamed the rise of ""not in my backyard"" movements on poor management by local authorities and promised measures to improve transparency and environmental reviews.

The bureau told the Global Times that the issue is still under discussion, while the parents say a resolution is urgent, as gaokao registration will take place from December 1 to 5.In March, Minister of Education Yuan Guiren said that the ministry would launch a policy concerning the non-local gaokao takers and would request the local bureaus to decide how to implement the changes.? So far Beijing education bureau has failed to issue any commitment as to when these non-local students will be able to sit the test in Beijing. Du Guowang, one of the some-50 parents who have protested at the bureau every Thursday since September 20, said time was running out for his Beijing-educated 17-year-old son.? ""I would have no choice but to send him back to Inner Mongolia [Autonomous Region] to sit his exam,"" he said. Du said that he is disappointed in the Chinese education system, and if his son cannot sit the exam in Beijing, he would have to sell his house to fund his son's university education overseas. A mother surnamed Jin from Heilongjiang Province said she will probably sue the education bureau for their delay in implementing the new policy.? She was also discontent because a foreigner can take the gaokao in Beijing, but not a Chinese citizen registered outside the capital.? ""This is not fair to us,"" she said.According to the Beijing gaokao application notice for 2013, issued Wednesday, applicants must either be a high school student with a Beijing hukou (household registration) or a foreigner with a permanent resident permit.? A media officer, surnamed Wang, from the Beijing Education Bureau said that despite the complaints of the non-local parents, it will take time to decide when students without a Beijing hukou could sit the gaokao here. ""It involves cooperation with other government bureaus like the public security bureau to push this policy forward,"" he said.For foreigners, the policy has been in place for years, he said. In November, Heilongjiang Province became the first region in China to enforce the regulation that migrants to the province can sit the gaokao, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Jiangsu and Anhui provinces have said they will follow suit from 2013.??

1832,11/27/12,Tibet Autonomous Region,China,Demonstrate or rally,Zhejiang Sheng,17865685,Kyodo: School in China's Qinghai Under 'Military Lockdown' After Mass Protest,"Hong Kong, Nov. 27 Kyodo -- (EDS: UPDATING WITH SCHOOL LOCKDOWN) Three more Tibetans have died after lighting themselves on fire to protest Chinese repression of Tibetans, bringing to at least 22 the number of self-immolations so far this month, the Tibetan government-in-exile said Tuesday.Sangay Dolma, a 17-year-old nun, died Sunday in Qinghai Province's Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture; Kunchok Tsering, an 18-year-old man, did likewise Monday in Gansu Province's Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture; and Gonpo Tsering, a 24-year-old man, did so in the same Gansu prefecture, the India-based Central Tibetan Administration said on its website.It said Gonpo Tsering set himself on fire in the prayer hall of the Ala Dheu Monastery. He raised slogans calling for freedom and respect for human rights in Tibet and the return of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, from exile in India.After his protest, local Tibetans from the neighboring villages gathered in huge numbers to offer their prayers and condolences, drawing a heavy presence of security forces, the report said.The three newly reported self-immolations come after it was reported Monday that former Tibetan monk Wangyalm, in his 20s, set himself on fire in Sichuan Province's Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture earlier that day. It was not known whether he survived as authorities quickly arrived on the scene and took him away.The government-in-exile said that despite its repeated appeals to Tibetans living under Chinese rule ""not to take drastic actions,"" 85 of them have self-immolated since February 2009 ""in protest against the Chinese government's repressive rule."" Most of them have died.Meanwhile, according to India-based news portal Phayul, Chinese authorities are keeping a medical school in Qinghai's Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture under ""military lockdown"" with students contained inside the campus following Monday's mass protest there against the Chinese government.The report said three students of the medical school have been arrested, while five of some 20 students injured during the police crackdown remained in critical condition.The students were calling for ""equality of nationalities, freedom of language, respect for truth, and reestablishment of governance,"" Phayul said. Chinese armed forces were seen in video clips using violent force to break up the demonstration.The protest was said to have occurred after Chinese authorities requested students to answer a 10-point political questionnaire and made ""disparaging remarks"" against the Dalai Lama in patriotic education sessions.Radio Free Asia quoted an exile source as saying the protest was in response to ""the distribution of a book condemning the study of Tibetan language as devoid of relevance and the self-immolations as acts of stupidity.""] The government-in-exile and the Dalai Lama have urged the Chinese government to address the underlying causes that are pushing Tibetans to set themselves on fire in Tibetan-populated parts of China's western provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan that were carved out of Tibet in the distant past.Chinese authorities vilify the Dalai Lama as an ""anti-China separatist"" seeking Tibetan independence ""under the cloak of religion,"" while alleging that he masterminded the 2008 riot in Lhasa and the self-immolations.The Tibetan spiritual leader, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, has renounced violence and insists that he only seeks ""genuine autonomy"" for Tibet to protect its culture, religion and language.[Description of Source: Tokyo Kyodo World Service in English -- English service of Japan's largest domestic and international news agency, owned by nonprofit cooperative of 63 newspaper companies and NHK]",Tokyo Kyodo World Service in English,Qinghai,"Gonghe Xian, Hainan Zangzuzizhizhou,  Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture,",17,1000,"http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/12/11/27/n3739616.htm%E4%B8%8D%E6%BB%A1%E4%B8%AD%E5%85%B1%E5%88%B6%E8%A3%81-%E9%9D%92%E6%B5%B7%E4%B8%8A%E5%8D%83%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E6%B8%B8%E8%A1%8C-%E4%BC%A0%E5%86%9B%E8%AD%A6%E5%BC%80%E6%9E%AA%E9%95%87%E5%8E%8B.html                  On Monday, about 1,000 students at a Tsolho Medical Institute staged a bold protest about 900 kilometers (550 miles) to the north in Hainan prefecture in Qinghai province.

In a statement late on Sunday, Huaxia said the deposit products the employee sold were four Zhongding-issued instruments, available since 2011, which were backed by returns from a pawn shop and a car sales company in the province of Henan.Police are investigating on the issue for alleged breaches of the law, the statement said, without giving more details.Huaxia's Shanghai branch at Jiading District suspended operations on Saturday, citing interior decoration one day after revelations began circulating on China's most popular microblogging platform Sina Weibo.[Description of Source: Beijing Caijing Online in English -- Website of an influential unofficial economic reform biweekly carrying in-depth, insider stories on financial and general economic issues; URL: http://www.caijing.com.cn/english/]",Beijing Caijing Online in English,Shanghai,"Lujiazui, ",13,30,"Bank: It is an all-too-familiar tale. Depositors trust a bank with their cash in the hope their wealth will be managed well, only to find that the money has evaporated at the end of the agreed term. In the latest scandal to rock China's banking industry, dozens of depositors lost their multimillion-yuan investments in a ""wealth management product"" (WMP) sold at a Shanghai branch of Huaxia Bank. The sorry saga was a rude reminder that Ponzi schemes thrive on the mainland, where millions of residents still believe that banks are the safest havens for their lifelong savings. On Tuesday evening, more than 40 depositors protested against alleged malfeasance by Huaxia Bank at an outlet in Jiading district in Shanghai. They vented their anger at the bank after being informed that Zhongding Wealth Investment Centre, which issued a WMP to them last year, would be defaulting on its repayment to them. ""Huaxia is a state-owned bank, and to some extent, it is doing business under the government's directions,"" an investor surnamed Gong said. ""How can we trust the government and the Communist Party ... now that a state-owned bank refuses to pay our money back?"" Fitch Ratings says mainland commercial banks have sold an aggregate 12 trillion yuan (HK$14.9 trillion) in WMPs, most of which offer a higher yield than banks' deposit rates and so are attracting an increasing number of customers. Gong, a retired worker, said she was convinced by Pu Tingting, a customer manager at the Jiading outlet, that the Zhongding product was worth buying. ""She told me the branch's chief had also bought the product,"" Gong said. ""I trusted the bank and its staff, so I decided to buy, too."" The WMP offered an annualised interest rate of 11 per cent, more than triple the benchmark deposit rate set by the central bank. Huaxia Bank said in a statement that Pu was a rogue employee and the product was sold without the bank's authorisation. An official at the Jiading outlet, who was from the bank's Beijing headquarters and declined to be identified, told the South China Morning Post that Pu had been taken by Shanghai police, who are carrying out a criminal investigation. The victims said their total investment in the Zhongding product could amount to more than 500 million yuan. Xiao Gang, chairman of Bank of China, warned the number of defaults in similar schemes could soar in the future and eventually trigger a liquidity crisis in the banking system. Mainland banks worked closely with trust companies or other entities that package trust loans into WMPs, with the lenders acting as middlemen to sell the products, Xiao wrote in a commentary published in the China Daily in October. The Zhongding WMP provides a vivid snapshot of the practices the institutions engage in. Zhongding raised the money through Huaxia Bank to fund the construction of car dealerships in Henan province. The victims said Huaxia Bank informed them the borrower was found to have committed crimes. ""Shouldn't Huaxia take responsibility?"" said Zhou Guowu, an investor who spent 500,000 yuan on the Zhongding product. A report on internet portal NetEase reported that Pu's husband said she had been made a scapegoat by the bank. At least five investors claimed they knew Pu well and said the bank encouraged her to promote the sale of the Zhongding WMP. ""Our money was deposited into Huaxia's accounts via the branch's counters,"" said one investor. ""For ignorant investors like us, we were buying Huaxia Bank's product and we want our money back from Huaxia."" An official with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, who asked not to be named, said the WMP sector had recently been spinning out of control in a fundraising spree. ""Lacking efficient regulations, more scandals are set to surface as banks blindly and aggressively issue WMPs,"" he said. ""What's worse, to our knowledge, some customer managers are helping cash-hungry businesses raise funds through the WMPs without official approval from the banks."" About 55 per cent of outstanding WMPs were scheduled to mature this quarter, and a further 19 per cent would expire in the next quarter, Fitch said. It said WMPs at mainland banks grew 3.5 trillion yuan in the first nine months of this year, of which 85 per cent were sold by mid-size joint-stock or city and rural commercial banks. ""Proceeds raised from the products containing credit can be used to repay, roll over or purchase borrowers' existing loans,"" Charlene Chu, Fitch's head of Chinese bank ratings, said in a report. ""This can give the appearance of high repayment rates of corporate loans - and by extension, strong banking-sector asset quality and corporate-sector health - when, in fact, the loans are not being repaid by borrowers themselves but rather by investors."" Xiao, who is tipped to replace Zhou Xiaochuan in March as the central bank's governor, has compared the proliferation of WMPs on the mainland to shadow banking. ""Regular banking and shadow banking are not isolated from each other,"" he wrote in the commentary. ""Many activities in the two systems feed into each other and could influence each other if things start to deteriorate.""

1852,1/7/13,Citizen (China),China,Demonstrate or rally,Guangdong Sheng,18094057,UPDATE 1-Chinese protest outside newspaper gates in rare censorship demo,"(Recasts, adds background)GUANGZHOU, China, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Scores of supporters of one of China's most liberal newspapers demonstrated outside its headquarters on Monday in a rare protest against censorship, backing an unusual strike by journalists against interference by the provincial propaganda chief.The protest in Guangzhou, capital of southern Guangdong province, comes amid an escalating standoff between the government and the people over press freedom. It is also an early test of Communist Party Chief Xi Jinping's commitment to reform.The outcry began late last week after reporters at the influential Southern Weekly newspaper accused censors of replacing an original New Year's letter to readers that called for a constitutional government with another piece lauding the party's achievements.Police allowed the demonstration outside the headquarters of the Southern Group, illustrating that the Guangdong government, led by newly appointed and rising political star Hu Chunhua, wants to tread carefully to contain rising public anger over censorship.The protesters, most of them young, laid down small hand-written signs that said ""freedom of expression is not a crime"" and ""Chinese people want freedom"". Many clutched yellow chrysanthemums, symbolising mourning the death of press freedom.""The Nanfang (Southern) Media Group is relatively willing to speak the truth in China so we need to stand up for its courage and support it now,"" Ao Jiayang, a young NGO worker with bright orange dyed hair, told Reuters.""We hope that through this we can fight for media freedom in China,"" Ao said. ""Today's turnout reflects that more and more people in China have a civic consciousness.""The attention paid to the protest domestically highlights the unique position of Guangdong, China's wealthiest and most liberal province and the birthplace of the country's ""reform and opening up"" programme. In a symbolic move, Xi chose to go to Guangdong on his first trip after being anointed party chief in November.On Sunday night, the Southern Weekly official microblog denied the removal of the New Year Letter was due to censorship, saying the ""online rumours were false"". Those remarks drew criticism from Chinese Internet users.Many Southern Weekly journalists disavowed themselves from the statement on the microblog, which they say was taken over by management, and pledged to go on strike the next day.Several open letters have circulated on the Internet calling for the Guangdong propaganda chief, Tuo Zhen, to step down, blaming him for muzzling the press.Photographs on microblogs showed banners that said ""if the toxin of Tuo isn't removed ... Guangdong will be castrated.""""Not since the time of reform and opening up and the founding of China has there been someone like Tuo Zhen,"" Yan Lieshan, a retired veteran editor at Southern Weekly, told Reuters by telephone. ""He's too arrogant, he has gone overboard and constantly violates regulations.""Xiao Shu, a former prominent commentator at the Southern Weekly newspaper, said Tuo required that journalists submit topics for him to approve and yanked issues that he disliked.""These details illustrate one problem: that he has established within the Guangdong media a system of prior censorship of the press,"" Xiao said, calling for Tuo's removal.Chinese Internet users already cope with extensive censorship, especially over politically sensitive topics like human rights and elite politics, and popular foreign sites Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube are blocked.China shut the website of a leading pro-reform magazine on Friday, apparently because it ran an article calling for political reform and constitutional government, sensitive topics for the party which brooks no dissent.(Additional reporting by Sui-Lee Wee and Beijing Newsroom, Writing by Sui-Lee Wee; Editing by Nick Macfie)",Reuters,Guangdong,Guangzhou,11,1000,"Nanfang (Southern) Media Group      Protestors gathered Monday at the offices of a Chinese newspaper at the centre of a censorship row to call for media freedom, in a rare demonstration on the subject in the country.Hundreds of people were protesting outside the Southern Weekly's office in Guangzhou, according to online reports, with one banner reading: ""We want press freedom, constitutionalism and democracy.""The demonstration in the southern city came after censors Thursday blocked a New Year article in the popular liberal newspaper calling for the realisation of a ""dream of constitutionalism in China"" to protect citizens' rights.                        http://www.ntdtv.com/xtr/gb/2013/01/08/a827254.html.-%E8%B4%B9%E8%89%AF%E5%8B%87%EF%BC%9A%E5%BC%BA%E7%83%88%E6%8A%97%E8%AE%AE%E4%B8%AD%E5%85%B1%E7%9B%91%E6%8E%A7%E5%B9%B2%E6%B6%89%E3%80%8A%E5%8D%97%E6%96%B9%E5%91%A8%E6%9C%AB%E3%80%8B.html"

1876,3/10/13,Protester (China),Military Personnel - Special (China),Demonstrate or rally,Guangdong Sheng,26533636,Police fire teargas on China village after land grab protest,"HONG KONG, March 10 (Reuters) - Chinese security forces fired tear gas and beat protesters in a village in southern China on Sunday to quell a grassroots protest movement over a land dispute, residents said.Dozens of villagers were taken to hospitals in Mianhu town and Jieyang city and five people were arrested, witnesses said.A large contingent of riot police and other security personnel moved into Shangpu village in southern Guangdong province early on Sunday morning, said several residents contacted by Reuters by telephone and on microblogging sites.""They didn't say a thing and started firing teargas and beating villagers with truncheons,"" said a young villager who witnessed the incident.""They had torches on their helmets, like miners, and were hitting some old people with truncheons who were sleeping in tents. They gave no warning.""Gongs were sounded and hundreds of villagers charged out to help those being beaten but were forced back by some 3,000 security personnel and volleys of teargas, villagers said.The unrest in Shangpu was triggered over a land deal involving some 33 hectares of rice paddies on the outskirts of the village that were leased cheaply to a firm called Wan Feng for 50 years to build an electric cable factory.The deal, made without majority village consent, was brokered by Shangpu's village committee chief Li Baoyu, according to a signed contract seen by Reuters.The villagers want the contract scrapped, their land returned and Li fired.In late February several hundred men, armed with steel pipes and spades, threatened the 3000-strong village to accept the land deal. Villagers, however, retaliated, chasing the men away and destroyed over 20 of their jeeps and cars.The villagers refused to allow authorities to clear away the gutted vehicles, demanding the land deal be scrapped first.But early on Sunday, however, tow trucks cleared away most of the vehicles from a highway outside the village. A small number remained on the main street.""We tried to stop them from doing this...If they tow away the cars, they won't do anything anymore,"" said a villager.A senior villager, who delivered a written indictment against the land sale to provincial leaders including Guangdong governer Zhu Xiaodan, said he was shocked and disappointed with Communist Party authorities for cracking down in this manner.Authorities in nearby Jieyang city have verbally agreed to scrap the land deal, senior villagers say, but they have not yet been offered written proof of this.The situation in Shangpu is similar to that of another high-profile standoff over land seizures in Wukan village, about an hour's drive away - that openly revolted for several months over murky land sales in 2011. Like Wukan, Shangpu villagers are also calling for elections to vote in a new village leader.(Reporting by James Pomfret; Editing by Angus MacSwan)",Reuters,Guangdong,Shangpu village,2,100,"Chinese security forces fired tear gas and beat protesters in a village in southern China on Sunday to quell a grassroots protest movement over a land dispute                  http://bbs.tianya.cn/post-free-3074395-1.shtml                     Gongs were sounded and hundreds of villagers charged out to help those being beaten but were forced back by some 3,000 security personnel and volleys of teargas, villagers said.The unrest in Shangpu was triggered over a land deal involving some 33 hectares of rice paddies on the outskirts of the village that were leased cheaply to a firm called Wan Feng for 50 years to build an electric cable factory."
1892,4/22/13,Activist (China),Communist Party (China),Demonstrate or rally,Beijing Shi,26814808,China Presses Crackdown On Campaign Against Graft,"BEIJING -- The Chinese authorities have detained six anticorruption activists in recent days, expanding their crackdown on a citizen-led campaign that, on the surface at least, would appear to dovetail with the new leadership's war on official graft.The detained activists, who include seasoned dissidents and a prominent rights lawyer, had been demanding that senior Communist Party officials publicly disclose their personal wealth, according to lawyers and rights advocates.The campaign, started late last year with a petition drive that garnered thousands of signatures, has tried to piggyback on a pledge by President Xi Jinping to clean up the endemic corruption he says poses an existential threat to the ruling Communist Party.In widely quoted comments published in January, Mr. Xi promised to take down ''tigers and flies'' -- a reference to high-ranking officials and middling bureaucrats -- but the public clamor for mandatory asset disclosure has so far received a tepid response from Chinese leaders.The campaign, called the New Citizens Movement by its organizers, has picked up steam in the five weeks since Mr. Xi consolidated power by adding the title of president to his other titles, Communist Party general secretary and chairman of the Central Military Commission.The change in leadership, the first in a decade, has given liberals hope, however faint, that Mr. Xi will shake up the status quo by increasing government transparency.On March 31, a small group of anticorruption activists unfurled banners at a plaza in central Beijing, a move that quickly drew the police. Three of those arrested are still in custody, and a fourth was released on bail for health reasons, his lawyer said Friday. All four are charged with illegal assembly, a crime that carries a potential five-year sentence.Of those arrested last week, four are still being held, according to their lawyers, who said the police had raided the homes of at least two detainees and confiscated laptops, video cameras and other items.The arrests have both infuriated and disappointed reformers and human rights advocates, who say the crackdown bodes ill for Mr. Xi's widely trumpeted war on graft. ''The party promised to publish officials' assets 30 years ago, something it has yet to do,'' said Xu Zhiyong, a lawyer and founder of the New Citizens Movement who is being held under house arrest. ''Clearly the government is afraid of this demand.''The men arrested last week include Zhao Changqing, a democracy advocate who has been jailed several times in the past; Ding Jiaxi, a human rights lawyer; and two activists, Sun Hanhui and Wang Yonghong. All four are being held at Beijing No. 3 Detention Center, lawyers for the men said.According to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a nongovernmental organization based in Washington, the whereabouts of two other activists, Qi Yueying and Li Wei, were unknown on Friday.Liang Xiaojun, a lawyer who represents several of those detained, said prison officials would allow him to see only one of the detainees, claiming that the others were still being interrogated by the police. ''I doubt this case will go through normal procedures,'' he said. ''Can you imagine a trial for a group of activists who demanded that government officials disclose their assets? I don't see that trial happening.''Analysts say the crackdown on dissent, coupled with newly announced media restrictions and the absence of any new anticorruption initiatives, are gnawing away at any hopes that Mr. Xi will embrace the rule of law and clean government.''These arrests do nothing to dispel the widely held opinion that public office is in essence a way to accumulate illegal wealth,'' said Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong. ''If the party is serious about rooting out corruption, it needs to stop placing itself above the law.''",NA,Beijing,,14,300,4/26 collective human right protection activity:        http://www.64tianwang.com/bencandy.php?fid-17-id-13147-page-1.htm

The statement said that the protesters blocked the road leading to the scene with coffins and hurled abusive language at the police and workers while attacking them. However, the county government did not say whether there were any injuries or any protesters were arrested. The Sansui Prosecutor's Office and a local court jointly issued a demand that the participants turn themselves in before May 11 or face severe punishment. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have listed the urbanization of rural areas ""to take better care of farmers"" as one of their policy priorities, and the Sansui land expropriation was interpreted by county officials as a project under this umbrella. However, the Sansui residents were quoted in online reports as saying that the violent protests only broke out after those who had their land expropriated discovered that it was to be used to build commercial properties or apartments for sale.

It has been alleged that Ms Yuan, from Anhui province, had been attacked by a group of men in the market where she worked and died trying to flee.Police initially claimed the death was a suicide and refused to release to her boyfriend or her mother security footage of Ms Yuan jumping to her death.The police refusal to investigate claims she had been attacked sparked a massive reaction on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Within hours, hundreds of protesters had surrounded the market, waving placards and banners demanding police reopen the case.The demonstration sparked a major police reaction, with nearly 2000 officers surrounding the protesters. Emergency service workers and police helicopters were dispatched.It was reported that some police were injured and protesters were arrested, but Chinese state-owned media reported little detail yesterday.The China Daily reported that police had warned there would be more arrests if the protests were to start again.The protest and the dead woman's name were blocked from internet searches and Weibo.

Demonstrators engaged in shoving matches with police but there were no serious clashes, according to the website.Online Chinese text reports appeared to have been censored, with searches for ""Kunming"" and ""PX"" leading to messages reading: ""The webpage you wanted to browse cannot be displayed for the time being.""But Internet users overwhelmed China's Twitter-like weibo services with support for the protesters.""There is a riot in the mind of the people of Kunming who are strangled,"" wrote user ""Director Wang Tingting"".Another blogger, ""Xi Xiaobudou"", said: ""Government and media, please do not lie -- we do not want the refinery to come to Kunming.""Others called for an online petition to block the plant.""I'm the 213,670th citizen to disagree with building the refinery in Kunming... everybody please forward the post and add a number,"" said ""Optimistic V"".According to the official news agency Xinhua, Kunming's mayor Li Wenrong has promised: ""The government will call off the project if most of our citizens say no to it.""China sees around 180,000 demonstrations a year on a wide range of issues, including some against proposed chemical plants in what analysts have identified as a rising trend of environmentally-motivated ""not in my backyard"" protests.Local authorities in the coastal city of Xiamen cancelled plans for a PX plant after thousands took part in a protest in 2007.

Police killed 11 rioters, while 21 police officers and civilians were injured.Xinhua said an unspecified number of ""mobsters"" stormed the government office, the police station, the People's Armed Police base and a construction site in Lukqun township, Shanshan county, at around 5.50am on Wednesday. The authorities did not mention that a PAP base was also among the targets of attacks until yesterday.It said four suspected rioters who were injured had been detained.It was the first Chinese-language report on the incident released by Xinhua, which carried an English report roughly seven hours after the attacks.Neither report mentioned the number of attackers, their ethnicity or what caused the attacks. But yesterday's report branded the incident a ""violent terrorist attack"".A visitor to Turpan yesterday said he saw a roadblock with armed police officers and about 20 police vehicles.A resident said a helicopter arrived on the scene along with many police and soldiers.The Global Times , a tabloid affiliated with the People's Daily , yesterday quoted an unnamed regional official as saying that ""earlier this year local police handled a case in which a store was attacked, which might have triggered that violence"".The attack came less than two weeks ahead of the fourth anniversary of ethnic clashes between Han Chinese and Uygurs in Urumqi , the regional capital, which left nearly 200 dead. Two months ago, 15 policemen or officials and six assailants were killed in another conflict in Bachu county, Kashgar , which involved attackers armed with knives and axes and the burning of a house.A Lukqun resident told the South China Morning Post by phone that local officials had told people to stay at home and be vigilant soon after the violence on Wednesday, adding that dozens of militia soldiers from his village were patrolling the streets.It was the deadliest unrest in the region since the media-savvy Zhang Chunxian became regional party secretary in April 2010, less than a year after the bloody clashes in Urumqi.The mainland authorities said clashes in 2011 that killed 19 were organised by terrorists who trained in Pakistan and were part of a separatist movement seeking an independent state in Xinjiang. But they did not give further details about the motive and background of the assailants in Wednesday's attack.Many Uygurs chafe at the central government's restrictions on their culture, language and religion.

3247,7/8/13,Tibet Autonomous Region,China,"Protest violently, riot",Beijing Shi,27330542,Reports say 6 Tibetans injured after Chinese paramilitary police fire on crowd,"BEIJING (AP) - At least six Tibetans were injured when Chinese paramilitary police fired on a crowd that was attempting to commemorate the Dalai Lama's birthday in a volatile part of western China, sources in the exile Tibetan community said Monday.The incident Saturday in the Sichuan province's Daofu county marks an escalation of tensions in an area already on edge over a wave of self-immolations by Tibetans and a massive security presence. Daofu, known in Tibetan as Tawu, and the surrounding prefecture of Ganzi were home to several of the reported 119 Tibetans who have set themselves on fire in protest over Chinese restrictions on Buddhism and denigration of the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India.Tawu Lobsang Jinpa, a former prisoner living in exile in India, said he was told of the shootings by a Tibetan Buddhist monk who was caring for one of those injured in the Saturday clash. The London-based International Campaign for Tibet said it confirmed the shooting, in which one monk suffered a serious head wound.They both said police fired guns and tear gas at about 500 Tibetans attempting to hold commemorations by scaling a hillside to burn incense and hang prayer flags calling for good health for the 78-year-old Dalai Lama, Tibet's traditional Buddhist leader who has been denounced as a political opportunist since escaping amid an abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959.Daofu lies in the former Tibetan territory of Kham that was separated from Tibet proper following China's occupation of the Himalayan region in 1950.

(Internet photo) Zhang Xiaochang, a businessman in Shenmu county in northwestern China's Shaanxi province, borrowed 10.1 billion yuan (US$1.65 billion) from individuals and banks to speculate on gold and silver futures, including 800 million yuan (US$130.5 million) of loans from Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) whose managers illegally approved excess loans, the Chinese-language Beijing News reports. On July 15, more than 1,000 people, many of them Zhang's creditors, gathered in front of the county government building demanding the party secretary Rui Zhengxi to resolve various problems before he transfers to another position. As of July 11, Shenmu's district court had handled 2,771 cases this year regarding private lending disputes, exceeding the 2,015 similar cases for the whole of last year and a number about four times the number of cases heard in 2011, the report said. In December last year, Zhang was reported to the authorities by a relative as his golden empire built up by excess borrowing with an interest rate as high as 3% a month suddenly crashed, throwing the local private lending market into crisis. Insiders said Zhang in 2008 used properties worth 70 million yuan (US$11.4m) to borrow 400 million yuan (US$65.2m) of loans from ICBC, whose staff broke the rules to lend Zhang an additional 400 million yuan. Thirty-seven staffers helped Zhang set up 37 dummy accounts, which then relent the money to Zhang. Zhang has borrowed 10.1 billion yuan in total, involving 1,380 persons who approved loans, more than 20,000 individuals, and 56 companies, as well as several government officials. On Dec. 1 last year, Zhang closed his three gold stores in Shenmu and rushed to the provincial capital Xi'an. Two of his friends persuaded to return to Shenmu to resolve the problems. The next day, Zhang's relative reported him to Shenmu's public security bureau. In 2012, when the coal market faced a severe slowdown, coal prices fell from 600 yuan (US$98) per tonne in 2010 to 400 yuan (US$65) per tonne, forcing some coal firm bosses to withdraw their money from Zhang, to whom they had previously lent due to the high rate of return he promised. Zhang likewise used to lend money to certain coal bosses at a monthly interest rate of 5%. As these debtors failed to pay back their money immediately and Zhang had suffered losses in his trading of gold and silver futures, he became the victim of his own sharking and could not pay the high interest on his own debts. After Zhang's affairs disintegrated, government officials didn't immediately freeze his assets but ICBC immediately sold 3.3 tonnes of gold Zhang used as collateral and five of Zhang's major clients dumped 120 tonnes of paper silver under Zhang's account (which they controlled by password), jointly obtaining 1.9 billion yuan (US$310m). On February 2, prosecutors arrested Zhang. Among Zhang's major creditors, ICBC's Shenmu branch contributed 800 million yuan, the said five major creditors provided 1.3 billion yuan (US$212m), and dozens of others, including bosses of some coal companies and other enterprises as well as retired government officials.",Want China Times,Shaanxi,Shenmu county,7,1000,http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/13/7/16/n3917747.htm

Are they only unfair to people like us or to everyone?"" said another woman, Lin Xiuli, 43.Lin said she had applied to attend Bo's trial, and came to see ""what the difference is between cases for top officials and for us regular people"".Bo, once one of China's highest-flying politicians, is set to go on trial Thursday for bribery and abuse of power.Attendance at the proceedings -- which analysts say are meant to bring to a close a scandal which exposed deep divisions and corruption at the highest levels of the Communist Party -- is likely to be strictly controlled, with independent media barred from entry.The protester detentions occured in front of a gaggle of reporters -- kept away from the courthouse by a cordon -- while more demonstrators arrived later.Several identifed themselves as petitioners -- citizens with decades of personal grievances who file complaints with more senior departments, but often face illegal detention.Lin said she had been petitioning for eight years over a civil case involving an ex-boyfriend, and had been detained more than 20 times for a total of more than 900 days.She and four other protesters had a noisy row with police, while another group who said they travelled to the courthouse from China's commercial hub Shanghai hurriedly handed papers to journalists and called out as police ushered them away.The extremely sensitive trial has been anticipated for around a year and a half, since Bo was dismissed from his position as head of the megacity of Chongqing and as a member of the ruling Communist Party's 25-strong Politburo.He is almost certain to be found guilty and face a hefty jail sentence, with the result of the trial decided by backroom political bargaining, analysts say.About 50 police practised drills in the morning on the grounds of the courthouse, a broad and stately structure with a Chinese flag at its entrance. They worked with sniffer dogs and a few wore bullet-proof vests.On a small bulletin board on the side of the courthouse was a short stamped notice announcing: ""This court is scheduled to hold the open trial for the bribery, corruption and abuse of power case of the defendant Bo Xilai on August 22 at 8:30 at Courtroom No 5.""A few passers-by stopped to read the announcement before walking quietly away.cdh/tjh/slb/sm",NA,Shandong,Jinan,14,10,http://www.boxun.com/news/gb/china/2013/08/201308220121.shtml#.VM-trFXF8Sg

The largely peaceful demonstration by workers with Shenzhen ASM Micro Electronic Technology drew dozens of police officers to the plants, where management shut the gates in an attempt to keep the situation from deteriorating. ""The management closed the gate at the three factories and stopped the workers from crowding together,"" said one worker. ""Dozens of police officers and officials from the local labour bureau arrived later and defended the gate. They were afraid that our workers would protest and block the road outside.""

The company, a subsidiary of ASM Pacific Technology which listed in Hong Kong in 1989, is the world's largest maker of machines and tools used in the semiconductor industry. Company representatives in Hong Kong and Shenzhen were unavailable for comment. According to the workers, a statement released at noon said two of the three factories would be relocated to Shenzhen's sub-district of Longgang and to Huizhou , a city more than 100 kilometres to the north, at the end of September next year.

In the statement, they did not call it a redundancy package but a bonus scheme,"" said another worker. Management would pay workers who moved a ""bonus"" equal to between 0.8 and 1.6 month's basic salary, depending on how long they had been employed by company, according to the worker. ""I have spent over five years doing this. But I was offered only 1,600 yuan [HK$ 2,023] compensation. That's very unfair,"" he said. Workers earned about 1,800 yuan a month, he said. ""According to the statement, workers would be not able to get the bonus until we have worked in the new factory for at least a year. The statement did not mention any details about the redundancy package for those who don't want to relocate,"" he said. ""The management told the workers the company would pay some compensation, but we must hand in a letter first saying we quit the jobs voluntarily.

3263,12/16/13,Mob (China),Police (China),"Protest violently, riot",Zhejiang Sheng,32367650,At Least 16 People Killed in Clash in China's Restive Xinjiang Region,"BEIJING--At least 16 people were killed in China's far-western Xinjiang region late Sunday in the latest bout of unrest in the ethnically divided region, local state media reported.Two police and 14 civilians were among the dead, according to a report by the region's government-controlled Tianshan news service. The incident occurred in a village near the far-west Xinjiang city of Kashgar, the report said. Local police couldn't be reached for comment and details of the incident couldn't be immediately verified.The state-media report said a gathering mob threw at least one explosive device at police and attacked them with knives, resulting in two police fatalities. Police in response shot dead 14 of the suspected assailants, the report said.The latest violence in Xinjiang follows the October attack on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, which authorities have said was committed by people from the region. Xinjiang is China's gateway to Central Asia, and is an important base of natural-resources production.State media did not identify the ethnicity of the assailants involved in Sunday's attack. The region is heavily populated by ethnic Uighurs--a Turkic-speaking minority group which has long inhabited Xinjiang--and many are hostile toward Chinese rule.In November, an attack on a police station east of Kashgar left 11 people dead, according to local authorities at the time.Write to Brian Spegele at brian.spegele@wsj.com16 Dec 2013 06:37 EDT At Least 16 Dead in Clash in China's Restive West - UpdateBy Brian SpegeleBEIJING--Fighting in China's far-western Xinjiang region left at least 16 people dead near the ancient city of Kashgar, marking the second major bout of unrest in the area in a month.Two police and 14 civilians were among those killed in a clash late Sunday, according to a brief report carried Monday by China's official Xinhua news agency. The incident occurred in Shufu County, the report said, to the southwest of Kashgar and near to China's border with Tajikistan.Chinese state media reports offered few details on the incident. Police reached in Shufu said they had no information on the reported attack, and the Kashgar government's information office didn't respond to a faxed request for comment.Xinhua cited unnamed sources as saying a mob of attackers first threw explosive devices at police and attacked them with knives as police were carrying out a search for a suspected criminal. Police in response shot dead 14 of the suspected assailants.The latest clash comes a month after an attack in November on a police station in the restive town of Selibuya--called Siriqbuya in the local Uighur language--located to the east of Kashgar. Eleven people, including nine assailants and two people working with police, were killed in that incident, according to the local government at the time.The attacks reflect challenges faced by authorities in divided Xinjiang. The region is heavily populated by ethnic Uighurs--a Turkic-speaking minority group which has long inhabited Xinjiang--as well as growing numbers of majority Han Chinese migrants, who have flooded the region in pursuit of growing business opportunities there.Large swaths of Xinjiang have been under virtual lockdown since July 2009 riots broke out in the regional capital of Urumqi, leaving about 200 people dead in some of the region's worst interethnic clashes.Since then, authorities have taken a two-pronged approach to the region. They have prioritized economic growth in Xinjiang which local residents say brought a surge of Han Chinese workers to the area. At the same time, local authorities have increasingly connected unrest in the region to overseas Islamist extremist groups operating in neighboring Pakistan and elsewhere.Xinjiang is strategically important to China as the country's gateway to the resource-rich nations of Central Asia. At the same time, authorities fear a spillover of violence and religious extremism found in neighboring Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region.Violence near Kashgar, once a hub of commerce on China's ancient Silk Road, follows the October attack on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, which authorities say was committed by people from Xinjiang.Assailants rammed their car into a crowd of tourists outside the Forbidden City in Beijing, killing two tourists and injuring some 40 others, according to an account given by police. Three assailants were also killed in the attack, which brought a renewed crackdown on parts of the region.China's top internal-security chief, Meng Jianzhu, subsequently blamed the October attack on the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which has been waging an often bloody separatist campaign in the region.While the Chinese government has increasingly pointed to religious extremism emanating from abroad as reason for gradually rising unrest in Xinjiang in recent years, many Uighurs in Xinjiang say resentment toward Chinese rule is more deeply rooted in increasingly evident economic disparities there.Write to Brian Spegele at brian.spegele@wsj.com(END) Dow Jones NewswiresDecember 16, 2013 06:37 ET (11:37 GMT)",NA,Xinjiang,Kashgar,17,14,"terror attack: December 16 -- Sixteen people -- 14 Uighurs and two police officers -- are killed in a clash in Shufu county.

The workers stood in front of the company's gate and crowded nearby roads in the morning, appealing for higher salaries and improvements in the company's management of firearms. The strike at Guangzhou Sui Bao Escort & Convoy is reportedly the result of a fatal accident on Feb 8, when an escort was killed when his shotgun accidentally discharged. According to Nanfang Daily, the strike held up the cash business of many Guangzhou banks. Customers couldn't get cash at the counter and needed to go to ATMs. Some banks also suspended deposit service because the escort company failed to deliver official seals to the banks. China Business News quoted a policeman at the scene of the strike as saying that the escort company is in charge of 80 to 90 percent of Guangzhou's cash escort market. Some complaints from the escorts on strike were a low monthly salary of about 2,000 yuan ($330); no subsidy for overtime work; no salary raises in years; and poor accommodations, according to the newspaper. The escort company's general manager agreed to offer a salary raise of 500 yuan on Feb 21, the newspaper added.

More than one hundred people including relatives of the dead man shouted and threatened the doctor at a hospital in Chaozhou, the Guangzhou Daily reported. A 37-year-old man had been admitted to the hospital after drinking excessively, the city government said in a statement on its social media account. He died in the early hours of the morning and relatives said the treatment he received was inadequate, the Guangzhou Daily said. Media on the mainland frequently report on patients assaulting medical staff. A doctor in Heilongjiang province was beaten to death with an iron bar last month, allegedly by a patient who was unhappy with the treatment he received. The Guangzhou Daily said the doctor in Chaozhou was paraded around the hospital by angry relatives for about half an hour on Wednesday. Watch: A Sina.com video shows the doctor surrounded outside the hospital Photos and videos posted online show the young doctor surrounded and shouted at by a few dozen people. The doctor cried as he was confronted in the hospital, with some in the crowd shouting, ""This is the doctor who killed the patient"", the newspaper reported. The police were called to restore order, the city government said. Two people who took part in the confrontation turned themselves in to the authorities later that day, the government statement added. DXY, a website for the medical community on the mainland, said on its social media account, citing sources at the hospital, that the hospital had at first agreed to give the patient's relatives 100,000 yuan (HK$126,000), but the offer had been withdrawn following the media attention. The hospital's directors did not respond to calls about the incident. A nurse in the department where the doctor worked denied any knowledge of the matter. The health bureau in Chaozhou and the Guangdong provincial health department also could not be reached for comment. In a separate case, a doctor in Hebei province was stabbed in the throat last month, allegedly by a patient dissatisfied with the outcome of an operation. People who cause violence in hospitals will be seriously punished, the mainland's health chief said, a day after a doctor in Guangdong was publicly humiliated over a patient's death. Li Bin, the minister of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said hospitals were places for saving lives and trouble-makers would be harshly dealt with. ""Violence against doctors is a serious crime and [perpetrators] will be severely punished according to the law,"" Li said. On Wednesday, a doctor at Guangdong's Chaozhou Central Hospital was paraded through the hospital for half an hour by more than 100 friends and family members of a patient who died on Wednesday after being admitted for excessive drinking. Relatives blamed the doctor for failing to properly treat the man, the government of Chaozhou said. The doctor was crying as the relatives shouted: ""This is the doctor who killed a patient,"" according to weibo messages posted by other doctors who said they witnessed the event. Doctors and nurses, especially in the mainland's public hospitals, have become targets for patients frustrated with the health care system. Queues to see doctors are long and consultations are kept short, which further adds to patients' resentment. Hospitals provided 7.3 billion out-patient consultations last year, a 6 per cent rise over the previous year. They saw 191 million patient check-outs, a 7.3 per cent increase over the previous year. About 70,000 complaints were lodged. Last week, a nurse at a Nanjing hospital was paralysed after being beaten by the mother of a patient. Due to space constraints, the nurse had placed a male patient in critical condition in the same ward as the woman's daughter. A doctor in Heilongjiang province was beaten to death with an iron bar last month, allegedly by a patient who was unhappy with treatment he received. Li said medical staff would strengthen their professional ethics, but people had to accept that doctors' abilities were not infinite. ""The public must understand ... medical science is limited and be reasonable about the limitations of science and technology,"" Li said. ""Doctors are not gods and can not cure patients every time."" Li said medical liability insurance should be promoted to solve disputes.

Although the demonstrations caused a traffic jam, the situation was ""rational and peaceful,"" it said.Later in the evening, however, a small number of people began to throw stones and water bottles in an attempt to destroy public facilities, the city said in a statement on its website.""The police were active immediately, handled it decisively and controlled the situation effectively,"" the local government said, adding that there were no casualties.Wu Jian, 30, said he took part in the protests on Sunday morning, which were peaceful.However, when he returned to the protests after work, he said he saw young people destroying public areas such as bus stops and clashing with police dressed in riot gear.Mr. Wu said Sunday's demonstrations were prompted after officials at the company in charge of the project, China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, met with Maoming authorities on Friday to discuss the planned facility.""The company came here and discussed the project without notifying residents and only met with government departments,"" he said.Mr. Wu said another demonstration was planned for Monday afternoon.Paraxylene, known as PX, is an important chemical in the production of plastics and other goods. The demonstration in Maoming recalls similar protests in October 2012 and August 2011 in the Chinese cities of Ningbo and Dalian, which also targeted PX-producing facilities.High levels of PX exposure can irritate the eyes and cause vomiting and respiratory discomfort, according to U.S. government and industry reports.Sunday's clash highlights the challenges faced by local governments, which increasingly must balance economic growth with a public that is increasingly environmentally conscious.On Thursday, the Maoming government released a 20-minute video online touting the benefits of the PX project. The video said the project would bring in annual tax revenue of 674 million yuan ($108 million) and 204 million in annual revenue for the local government.The project's risks ""will be knowable, controllable and preventable,"" the video said, adding that the project's construction and operation will be overseen by Sinopec Maoming Co., a subsidiary of Sinopec that is a ""well-established"" company in the industry.A Sinopec Maoming spokesman couldn't be reached for comment, and a representative for parent company Sinopec didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.The Maoming facility will have the capacity to produce 600,000 metric tons of PX a year and is part of the planned expansion of Sinopec's existing oil-refining complex, which was first built in 1955, according to the local government. The PX project, which the Maoming government says will generate annual revenue of 16.7 billion yuan, has been in the works since as early as 2006 and encountered local opposition as early as 2009, according to state media.Wayne Ma and Lillian Lin contributed to this article.(END) Dow Jones NewswiresMarch 31, 2014 08:18 ET (12:18 GMT)",NA,Guangdong,Maoming,5,10000,PX           http://www.boxun.com/news/gb/china/2014/03/201403310051.shtml#.VNA3bVXF8Sg

Protesters marched from outside Maoming government headquarters to People's Square in the afternoon, carrying red flags and placards condemning the authorities' use of force against demonstrators and demanding that the controversial scheme to build the plant be scrapped. Some of the placards said ""justice for the killed and injured"" and ""the Maoming government is ruthless and brutal"", according to photographs of the march posted on social media. The pictures were later deleted by censors. Watch: Hundreds protest against chemical plant in China's Maoming city The city's public security bureau has admitted that police ""accidentally injured"" 11 protesters in the first protest on Sunday and has apologised. More than 1,000 people took part in the initial demonstration. A deputy chief of the bureau denied online accounts that several protesters were killed in Sunday's protest. Maoming residents have been demonstrating against the proposed construction of a 3.5 billion yuan (HK$4.4 billion) paraxylene (PX) plant at the city's existing petrochemical complex run by the local government and the state-owned oil giant Sinopec. They fear it will pose a threat to public health and the environment. Paraxylene is a chemical essential to the manufacture of plastic bottles and polyester clothing. Proposals to build PX plants have sparked mass protests since 2007 in cities including Xiamen in Fujian , Dalian in Liaoning and Kunming in Yunnan. Demonstrations over the Maoming plant spread to Guangdong and Shenzhen even after the local authorities held two press conferences promising that construction would not start before consensus was reached. In the second day of protests in Shenzhen yesterday, about a dozen protesters gathered outside Luohu train station despite a heavy police presence, Hong Kong's Now TV reported. In Maoming, a local resident said her niece, a seven-year-old primary school pupil, had been taught at school that the project would have little impact on the environment and would bring huge economic benefits to the city. ""Both my niece and her parents were also asked to sign a letter promising that they would not join any protests,"" she said. ""The government is just trying to calm the situation and put a lid on the whole thing as it's determined to push ahead with the PX project. We will protest until it is cancelled,"" she said. A deputy mayor of Maoming told a press conference on Thursday the project was still in the very early planning stage and there was no timetable yet for construction. However, an official document released in April last year by Guangdong's planning agency - the provincial development and reform commission - said construction was slated for between 2011 and this year. The Maoming government said the planned plant, with capacity to produce 600,000 tonnes of the chemical each year, would help build the city into a world-class petrochemicals base.",South China Morning Post,Guangdong,Luohu train station,5,100,"http://www.ntdtv.com/xtr/gb/2014/04/03/a1094916.html                    Hundreds demonstrate in Maoming and Shenzhen against proposal; school pupil and parents asked to sign pledge not to join inSeveral hundred people in Maoming in southern Guangdong staged another rally yesterday against a proposed chemical plant, with the public still apparently deeply distrustful of assurances from officials that no decisions have been made on whether to push ahead with the scheme.Protesters marched from outside Maoming government headquarters to People?s Square in the afternoon, carrying red flags and placards condemning the authorities? use of force against demonstrators and demanding that the controversial scheme to build the plant be scrapped."

(Internet photo) Several thousand workers from Dongguan's largest shoe factory, Yue Yuen, took to the streets on Sunday to protest a disagreement over benefits and labor contracts, reports Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po. The protesters are accusing the shoemaker of deceiving staff by giving the same social security benefits to workers who have been with the company for more than 10 years as to casual staff and of signing void labor contracts. The factory has reportedly promised to give staff an official response by April 14 and claims that production has not been affected. Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings, headquartered in Hong Kong and established by its Taiwanese parent company Pou Chen Group is the largest branded athletic and casual footwear manufacturer in the world. Its Dongguan factory was established in 1988 and employs more than 60,000 workers who make shoes for major brands such as Nike, Adidas and Reebok. A worker surnamed Yang told the paper that several workers at the factory recently became aware that their social security benefits were based on income far lower than their actual earnings. Yang said he had been working for Yue Yuen for 20 years and earns about 3,000 yuan (US$485) per month on a labor contract without a limited term. After checking with local authorities, however, he discovered that his employer had been paying social security benefits based on a salary of just 1,810 yuan (US$290), a level equivalent to casual workers. Another worker, surnamed Li, said he has been working at Yue Yuen for more than 10 years but when he tried to enroll his child at a Dongguan school using his employment contract he was told that the document was legally void. Many of his colleagues have also experienced the same thing when trying to enroll their own children, he added.",Want China Times,Guangdong,Dongguan,13,30000,"http://www.chinanews.com/sh/2014/04-05/6034322.shtml                 Thousands of workers in South China's largest shoe company marched in protest in the city of Dongguan, Guangdong Province over contract and social security benefit issues.Some 2,000 to 3,000 out of 40,000 striking workers took to the street in protest on Tuesday morning, said a worker who requested anonymity.They marched from the factory to Gaobu town government building and staged a sit-in protest, he told the Global Times."

(Photo/CNS) A week after 30,000 workers from the Yue Yuen shoe factory in Dongguan in southern China's Guangdong province took to the streets over invalid contracts, 2,000 workers from another of the company's factories, located in Ji'an in eastern China's Jiangxi province, have also joined the strike, reports the Hong Kong-based Oriental Daily. Operated by the Taiwan-based Pou Chen Group, the Yue Yuen factory in Dongguan's Gaobu township is one of the biggest shoe factories in China and produces footwear for more than 30 top brands such as Nike, Adidas and Reebok. The factory currently employs more than 60,000 workers. The protest began on Apr. 14 when workers found out that the factory had failed to pay its employees their full social security and housing fund contributions. A senior factory worker surnamed Li told the web portal Nanfang that he was unable to use his permanent work contract as evidence of local residence in order to enroll his child in a local school because he was told his contract was not legally binding. Migrant workers like Li must present documents which prove to the local authority that they and their family members have stayed in the province for at least five years before their children are allowed to study in the area. In addition to the invalid contracts, the factory also cheated its workers in regards to their insurance packages, with some having to pay 40,000 yuan (US$6,400) while others only had to pay 10,000 yuan (US$1,600) for the same scheme. Following these issues coming to light, workers decided to strike to demand that the factory sign new contracts with them and improve their working conditions. So far, the factory has arranged a round of negotiations with the strikers, however a consensus has yet to be reached. Following the action of their counterparts in Dongguan, 2,000 workers from Ji'an decided to down tools in protest over unfair treatment on Apr. 20.

3441,7/21/14,Protester (China),Police (China),"Protest violently, riot",Beijing Shi,35032773,Chinese police clash with protesters over cross removal,"BEIJING, July 21 (Reuters) - Police in eastern China clashed in the middle of the night with Christian protesters massed around their church on Monday, but failed to carry out a government order to remove a cross from the building, according to witnesses and online accounts.Several people were injured in the two-hour melee.Dozens of churches in the wealthy province of Zhejiang have received government notices in the past few weeks demanding the demolition of church buildings or removal of crosses in what the government says is a campaign aimed at illegal structures, the U.S.-based Christian group ChinaAid says.Rights groups and Christians say it amounts to religious persecution, which ignores the protection of religious freedom in China's constitution.In the latest move, police tried to remove a cross from a church in Pingyang county close to Wenzhou city. But the congregation surrounded the church and prevented police from getting close, two witnesses said.""We did not want them to get close, so we joined up to stop them getting in, but they came at us and beat us,"" one of the protesters, who gave his family name as Zhang, told Reuters by telephone, putting the number of police at about 500.Zhang said police had been unable to remove the cross, but had locked down the site.Another witness, who asked not to be identified, said the clashes had started at 2 a.m. and went on for two hours. She knew of at least five people who needed hospital treatment.""We are Christians and are not looking for trouble, and if the government comes to us with reasonable requests, we will not oppose it.

2070,7/31/14,Protester (China),Police (China),Demonstrate or rally,Zhejiang Sheng,35107872,"After Deadly Clash, China and Uighurs Disagree on Events That Led to Violence","BEIJING -- More details emerged Wednesday about a bloody clash between Chinese security forces and ethnic Uighurs in the country's far west two days ago, suggesting that dozens of people died when a protest against government policies turned violent.The official news agency Xinhua described the confrontation, in the Xinjiang region, as a ''violent terrorist attack that was organized, premeditated and carefully planned.'' But Uighur exile groups, citing sources in the region, said that the police had used excessive force on a crowd of protesters outside government offices in Yarkand County and that rioting had later broken out across several rural townships.A government-run website on Wednesday blamed Islamic fundamentalists for the unrest but provided no evidence for the claim. Xinjiang is home to most of China's 10 million Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim people who populate the string of ancient oasis towns and cities that were once way stations on the Silk Road.Among the dead were at least 13 police officers and 20 Uighurs, according to the World Uyghur Congress, which is based in Germany. Xinhua said only that ''dozens of Uighur and Han civilians were killed or injured,'' adding that rioters, armed with knives and axes, had assaulted passers-by and vandalized more than 30 cars, some of which were set on fire. A majority of Chinese belong to the Han ethnic group.Still, details about the violence remained sparse, and most Chinese news outlets carried the same brief bulletin by Xinhua. Local officials declined to comment Wednesday, and the government severed Internet links to much of the region, including the city of Kashgar, more than 120 miles from the reported clashes.The authorities also canceled the Kashgar Commodity Fair, an annual convention that draws hundreds of businesspeople from across Central Asia. Residents reached by telephone said text messaging had also been disabled.''We're afraid,'' said an ethnic Han woman who works for a courier company in Elishku, the township where the rioting began. ''We're just trying to stay inside and not venture out.''According to the state-run Global Times, the unrest began after some Uighurs who had been stopped at a checkpoint were found to be carrying explosives; the assailants fled and later held passengers on a bus hostage. The account, citing ''knowledgeable sources,'' said police officers from other cities in the region had been sent to Yarkand to contain the rioting that followed.But overseas Uighur advocacy groups, citing sources in the region, provided a different account. They said the clash had been prompted in part by an ''antiterrorism'' campaign, begun in May, that has intensified many of the existing constraints on Uighurs living in the fertile crescent of southern Xinjiang, an area that has been increasingly resistant to Beijing's rule.In addition to anger over measures discouraging women from wearing veils in public, many residents were upset by restrictions on the observance of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, which ended Monday.''There has been a lot of pent-up frustration over house-to-house searches and checking on head scarves,'' a local security official, Alim Adurshit, told Radio Free Asia.An additional factor might have been the killing of a Uighur family this month in the county by Chinese security forces after a dispute over head scarf checks ended in gunfire. The dead, in the township of Beshkent, included five members of one household, among them a 7-year-old boy and his 72-year-old grandfather, Radio Free Asia said, citing a village chief.''From what I know, they took to the streets to express their anger over the incident,'' the chief, Aytullah Tursun, told the news service.The Uyghur American Association, a group in Washington, said residents of Beshkent had then gathered outside government offices and a police station in Elishku Township for what the association described as a protest. Xinhua, however, called the crowd ''a mob'' and said it had been armed with knives.Much like the episode in Yarkand, the escalating violence in the region, which has claimed hundreds of lives this year, is subject to different narratives. Exile groups and human rights advocates attribute many of the deaths to what they say is excessive force used to crush peaceful protests; the government often casts such disturbances as the work of religious fundamentalists.In an editorial published Wednesday with the headline ''Resolutely Smash the Enemy's Evil Plot,'' the Xinjiang government's news portal, Tianshan, blamed ''brainwashed terrorists'' for the most recent violence and urged people to embrace a more tolerant form of Islam. ''To purge religious extremism is an urgent, long-term and vital task facing us,'' the editorial said.Discovering the truth about the growing unrest in Xinjiang is challenging. Government restrictions make independent reporting difficult, and Uighurs who provide foreign journalists with information about such politically charged matters can face severe punishment.Large parts of the region have been under a de facto state of emergency since May, when assailants attacked an outdoor vegetable market in the capital, Urumqi, leaving 43 people dead, including four men who had driven vehicles into a crowd of shoppers while throwing homemade explosives.The authorities later described the assailants as Islamic separatists.Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, said on Wednesday that such violence was likely to escalate unless the government addressed some of the underlying grievances that feed popular discontent, especially what he described as the excessive and lethal use of force by security forces.''Beijing's desire to maintain so-called stability through repression and extreme policies is actually a self-illusion,'' he said.

""We express our heartfelt gratitude to His Holiness Dalai Lama for granting the Tibetan people the precious gift of democracy,"" said Sangay.""The gift of democracy given to us by the Dalai Lama has provided us with a voice and the power to influence our own future.

""Burning will definitely cause air pollution. We are concerned about the health of our children.""A public notice by the Boluo county government said about 1,000 people gathered in the county seat's public square to question the location for the proposed project. Protesters and eyewitnesses, however, estimated that 10,000-20,000 people joined the rally, and provided photos showing thick crowds as wide as four car lanes moving down streets.The demonstration came several months after a massive protest over a proposed waste incinerator in the eastern city of Hangzhou left at least 10 demonstrators and 29 police officers injured in May.China's cities are challenged with the daunting task of properly disposing of huge amounts of trash generated by the country's growing and increasingly affluent urban population. Experts and government officials believe high-standard incinerators can be a feasible solution to ensure public sanitation.Yet members of the Chinese public are not ready to accept government proposals for trash incinerators despite repeated assurances that such projects will have minimal environmental impact. Rather, they remain deeply skeptical about their local governments.Observers have said that a lack of transparency and meaningful public engagement have sowed the distrust.""There also have been some old scores to settle as the governments have promised the use of some technology, but, as it should turn out, the technology does not get implemented properly in operation,"" said Wu Yixiu, head of the environmental group Greenpeace's toxics campaign in East Asia.In the public notice posted on its official microblogging account, the Boluo county government said it would ""further gather reasonable and lawful suggestions and opinions from the public"" and would ""pick the project site scientifically and in accordance of the law.""Some of the demonstrators and eyewitnesses told The Associated Press by phone that Saturday's spontaneous protest in the town of Luoyang, the Boluo county seat, was orderly until police snatched banners from the protesters, dispersed crowds by force and dragged away demonstrators and spectators. They complained that the government had censored media coverage of the protest and banned those on public payrolls from joining it.Calls to the local government and police in Boluo rang unanswered.Photos provided by eyewitnesses and those circulating in China's social media showed protesters holding up banners opposing the incinerator as they marched through Luoyang's streets, despite periodical rain showers.The protesters said the crowds also shouted slogans such as ""Protect the homeland"" and ""Refuse trash.""___Associated Press researcher Henry Hou contributed to this report.",AP,Guangdong,"Boluo county, Huizhou",5,10000,http://slide.news.sina.com.cn/s/slide_1_2841_69302.html#p=5       At least five people were detained by police on Sunday in Huizhou in Guangdong for allegedly spreading false information online to _incite protests against a waste incinerator project.

(Internet photo) Two people were reportedly killed and hundreds were injured on Monday after the Chinese government sent police, armed vehicles and helicopters to disperse the ten thousand protesters in Guizhou's Sansui county, who took to the street in protest against the county government, which expropriated a large amount of land at low prices under false pretenses, reports Boxun, a Chinese-language citizen journalism site that is sourced mostly by anonymous users. On Monday morning, over 10,000 Sansui residents skipped classes and work to demonstrate in the square in front of the county government's office, according to the website. Witnesses said police officers attacked protesters and injured hundreds of them. Several protesters were arrested while the vehicles in the square were all smashed. One of the witnesses said the overwhelming number of police, water-canons and police dogs made the square looks like the front line in a war. The number of injured strained the capacity of local hospitals and some of the injured had to be transferred to other hospitals nearby. Protesters who rushed to the hospital to confirm the two deaths were attacked and arrested and then the building was locked down for an hour before the bodies and the protesters disappeared, said an internet user going under the handle Sansui Ren 1. Another internet user who said he witnessed the events, going under the handle Yang Ping, said around 20 student protesters were seriously injured during the police crackdown. Residents took to the street after the county government failed to fulfill its promise of having a city administration center built in the county after it was merged into a city with nearby Zhenyuan county and Qingong county. The Sansui county government expropriated a large amount of land at low prices for the administration center but the government of the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong autonomous prefecture decided on Sept. 28 to build the center in Qingxi in Zhenyuan county instead. An internet user said a party secretary of the Sansui County Committee bought 53 square kilometers of land in Qingxi and used their influence to force local representatives to build the center there. The failure of the county government to deliver on their promise has led to protesters threatening to reject the merger if the center is not built in Sansui and demanding the government return the lands seized for the center and compensate businesses attracted to the county because of the center. Tensions escalated on Oct. 11 when the county's businesses, workers, taxi drivers and some students joined the protests and marched toward the county government. The Guizhou provincial government deployed thousands of police from across the province in an attempt to quell the protest that evening.",Want China Times,Guizhou,Sansui county,2,10000,"Monday after the Chinese government sent police, armed vehicles and helicopters to disperse the ten thousand protesters in Guizhou's Sansui county, who took to the street in protest against the county government, which expropriated a large amount of land at low prices under false pretenses                  http://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/yl-10132014084328.html"

Kalsang Yeshi, a Tibetan monk of the Nyitso Monastery in Daofu County, set himself on fire in front of a police post near the monastery Tuesday, the Tibetan news portal Phayul quoted Lobsang Jinpa, a Tibetan residing in India, as saying. Kalsang chanted slogans calling for the return of the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama to the Tibetan regions in China and freedom for Tibet before he succumbed to severe burns, the India-based Central Tibetan Administration said on its website, identifying him as 32 years-old. Police fired warning shots as some 1,000 Tibetans gathered outside the police station demanding the return of Kalsang's body. Communications were limited as the situation remained tense in the area, the Tibetan government said. Kalsang's death was the third immolation in less than two weeks by Tibetans against what they claimed China's oppression. Twenty-year-old Tibetan Tsepey Kyi burned herself to death Monday in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, while Sangye Khar a 34-year-old man self-immolated in front of a police station in northwestern China's Gansu Province Tuesday last week.
